= 4.6.1 =

Technical build, probably the last for Far 2.

= 4.6.0 =

*) Asynchronous jobs
Fixed potential deadlocks of posting jobs which post new jobs themselves.

*) IEditor
New property Line, the current line. The old way of getting the current line
by the index -1 is deprecated, it does not work, for example, in PowerShell
V3 CTP2. It still works in C# and PowerShell V2 but from now on this is not
documented feature. It can be removed in future versions.

= 4.5.1 =

*) Some new .NET 3.5 features
- Replaced a few not significant delegates with Func<> generics.

*) Changed CurrentUICulture inference from %FARLANG%
Used specific cultures instead of neutrals e.g. en -> en-US, ru -> ru-RU, ..
Neutrals are not always suitable (e.g. PowerShell help does not know "en").

= 4.5.0 =

*) Target .NET framework is 3.5

FarNet and its modules are now built for .NET 3.5. At the same time the core is
configured to run with .NET 4.0 if it is available. Thus, modules targeted for
.NET 4.0 are supported and .NET 3.5 is not needed if .NET 4.0 is installed.

The game is over for Windows 2000, RIP. If .NET 3.5 is not yet installed and
Windows is XP SP3 or above then consider to install .NET 4.0 (unless 3.5 is
really needed for something else). 4.0 is much smaller, just in case.

Existing modules built for .NET 2.0 still work, rebuild is not needed. But when
such modules are built next time their target framework should be set to 3.5.

*) Roaming and local data locations
GetFolderPath() methods are based on the environment variables FARPROFILE,
FARLOCALPROFILE if they are defined and not empty (introduced in Far 3, 2091).
Otherwise they use roaming and local paths as usual. Thus, it is possible now
to configure the locations of FarNet and its module settings and working files.

*) IFar
(mostly for internal use though this API is officially public)
New GetModuleManager(string). It is faster than GetModuleManager(type) and it
can be used if a type is not yet available because its assembly is not loaded.
In some cases names are not known directly and the old method is still used.

= 4.4.21 =

*) Editor color API (revised)
- IEditor: GetColors(), AddColor() work with the ColorSpan class.

*) Not standard FarNet late loading
Fixed a few issues in cases when FarNet is loaded after opening editors.

= 4.4.20 =

*) Editor color API
This API is experimental and not yet recommended for public use, it is added
for the RightWords module for highlighting of misspelled words in editors.
- IEditor: new methods GetColor(), SetColor(); new class LineColor.
- New EditorRedrawMode enum, EditorRedrawingEventArgs uses it.

= 4.4.19 =

*) Bug
Fixed DirectoryNotFoundException on reading the module cache at start.

= 4.4.18 =

*) Help helpers

New IFar.GetHelpTopic() helps to format strings for HelpTopic properties like
"<C:\...\MyModule\\>Topic" (but in fact format details are hidden in this way).

New IFar.ShowHelpTopic() is a simple method for simple cases. The old and not
quite simple ShowHelp() still works as usual. But it is kind of deprecated now.

*) FarNet.Demo module
Added two help files (en, ru) and examples of using help files in the code:
a) HelpTopic property of the menu;
b) explicit call of ShowHelpTopic().

*) Module setting
- Added remarks about recommended data types to ModuleSettingsProvider.
- Module settings panel is not closed (by pressing [Esc]) if data are invalid
and Save() throws an exception. Forced close (open another panel) is allowed.

*) IEditor
New ConvertPointEditorToScreen(), in addition to ConvertPointScreenToEditor().

= 4.4.17 =

*) Module settings panel and engine

Default setting names start with '-'. Ever edited setting names start with '+'.
See more about defaults in the panel help [F1].

Reset to defaults ([Del], [F8]) works for all settings, with or without default
values explicitly defined by settings attributes.

[CtrlF11] in settings shows default / edited (- / +) data sorted separately.

For developers: see ModuleSettingsProvider API docs for some technical details.

*) FarNet.Demo module (included as sources)

Though it is a demo module it includes tools that can be useful for developers:

`Tracing` tool shows the menu that allows to change the level of tracing used
by the core and to turn tracing to the file on/off. It can be handy if you do
not have or use DebugView.exe from Sysinternals or similar diagnostics tools.

`demo: process` command shows some useful info about the current process.

`demo: assembly` command shows currently loaded .NET assemblies.

HINT: Tracing level and listeners can be set permanently in Far.exe.config,
for example in order to trace loading of preloadable modules. FarNet.Demo
allows to do that temporary for the already started session.

= 4.4.16 =

*) New FarNet module file structure and loading rules

Simplified the module file structure. See Readme.txt for details. It is now
mandatory that the module directory and the base assembly names are the same
(just like it is for Windows PowerShell modules).

Modules may have any other .dll files in their directories. There is no need in
using .CFG files in order to tell the core what .dll should be loaded exactly.
Thus, .CFG files are not used now.

Review your modules and make sure they follow these new rules.

*) Bugs in the module settings panel (but settings work fine)
- Some default values were shown empty.
- Settings were not saved if only reset to defaults was used ([Del] or [F8]).

= 4.4.15 =

*) IFar
- All Post*(EventHandler) methods are replaced with Post*(Action). Practice
shows that EventHandler is redundant. This change is breaking but not many
modules should be affected (the latest PowerShellFar is updated).

*) IModuleManager.GetFolderPath()
- Added the 'bool create' parameter, so that creation is now optional and
it is requested only when it is really needed (on writing files). Thus:
-- Better performance (some expensive checks of existence are avoided)
-- No more empty profile sub-directories (you can remove them now)

*) Module settings engine
- Binary serialization should work fine now (with usual caveats).
- Saves one file if just one of Local and Roaming sets is dirty.
- Other tweaks.

*) Module settings panel
- Better validation of entered values (consider to [F2] before closing editors).
- Values serialized as XML can be edited as XML. Normally such data should be
[Browsable(false)] (excluded from UI) but it's up to a developer, after all.

*) Sample modules in FarNet\Modules
Replaced sample modules Tutorial-Command, Tutorial-Filer, Tutorial-Host with
one module FarNet.Demo with its Visual Studio solution/project. Features:
  * Host class (not pre-loaded)
  * Menu tool class (all areas)
  * Command class (prefix `Demo:`)
  * Filer class (`*.resources` files)
  * Explorer class (used by the filer)
  * Settings classes (various settings)
  * Localized module resources (English and Russian)

*) Misc
- IFar.PostJob uses delegate chains instead of job queues.
- Cache.binary does not use FarNet types (bullet-proof and effective way).

= 4.4.13 =
= 4.4.14 =

### No official Windows registry support for modules

Modules should use new standard FarNet settings (see ModuleSettings from new
FarNet.Settings.dll) or take care of settings on their own. In the latter case
it is recommended to use files in local or roaming folders (see IModuleManager
GetFolderPath()). Note: all names like FarNet.* are reserved.

*) New .NET menu item "Settings..."
Shows modules with at least one settings set implemented and opens the settings
panel for a selected module settings set. Use [F1] for help. The panel UI is
rather simple but it is quite enough. To be improved when needed/requested.

*) FarNet module cache (just in case of problems):
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Far Manager\FarNet\Cache.binary

These old registry data can be removed manually:
Far2\Plugins\FarNet
Far2\Plugins\FarNet.Modules

FarNet itself does not use registry when deals with modules. But it still uses
registry because Far 2 does. Thus, FarNet.Works.Registry.dll still exits and
IFar.OpenRegistryKey(), too, just in case if some module needs registry data.

*) Modules with old FarNet registry tools should be updated and some settings
migrated. PowerShellFar, RightControl, and Vessel use new settings approach, so
that their settings can be viewed/modified in the new module settings panel.

### Other changes

*) Panels
- Removed KeyPressing event (Far 3 is going to drop it, perhaps).

*) 4.4.14
Fix for localized modules.

= 4.4.12 =

*) XPath searches
- Fixed occasional error messages on stopping a search.
- Optimized memory use during search (weak references allows to discard some of
not used data). This introduces a little overhead but on large data sets saves
a lot of memory, avoids out of memory cases, and even may work faster.

= 4.4.11 =

*) XPath searches
- Optimized the XPath navigator (performance gain is about 30%).
- Changed File and Directory attributes: boolean flags (ReadOnly, Archive, ...)
always exist, their values are 0 (false) and 1 (true).
- XPath files (.xq) can contain comments and variable declarations with defined
values or external. In the latter case an input box is shown in order to input
values. All this stuff has to be placed before the XPath expression.
Demo XPath file:
http://farnet.googlecode.com/files/_110428_160407_Demo-XFile.xq.htm

*) SearchFileCommand
- New property XVariables allow to perform XPath queries with variables.

= 4.4.10 =

*) XPath queries in file searches and related tools
- Added parameters XFile, XPath to the Explore module 'explore:' command.
- Extended the XPath engine with custom helper functions:
* equals(p1, p2) : string.Equals(p1, p2, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)
* compare(p1, p2) : string.string.CompareOrdinal(p1, p2)
* is-match(p1, p2) : Regex.IsMatch(p1, p2)

See some examples of XPath queries in Readme.txt of the Explore module.

HINT: use .xq extensions for files with XPath expressions, so that Colorer
processes them as xquery. This is not the same, indeed, but it's quite fine.

= 4.4.9 =

*) Panel
Converted one more internal method into public virtual:
- WorksViewChanged -> UIViewChanged

= 4.4.8 =

*) Panel
Converted some more internal methods into public virtual:
- WorksCtrlBreak -> UICtrlBreak
- WorksGotFocus -> UIGotFocus
- WorksLosingFocus -> UILosingFocus
- WorksRedrawing -> UIRedrawing
- WorksUpdateInfo -> UIUpdateInfo

= 4.4.7 =

*) Panel
Converted some more internal methods into public virtual:
- WorksClosed -> UIClosed
- WorksClosing -> UIClosing
NOTE: UIClosing is useful but buggy:
http://bugs.farmanager.com/view.php?id=602

= 4.4.6 =

*) Panels & explorers
- ImportFiles supports the FilesToStay list and selection recovery.
- ExportFiles: target panel is updated to show new items without a delay.
- New *CloneFile* family of methods for [ShiftF5] in panels.
- New method Navigate(), only for the same type explorers ~ same virtual FS.
- Removed the dialog from UIRename() and NewName from RenameFileEventArgs, it
is completely up to panels and explorers what they do and show on operations.
- Select|UnselectNames parameter is IEnumerable now (and ToString() is used).

*) UI menu: .NET \ Panels
- New commands "Decrease left column", "Increase left column" work for module
panel if its current view has two columns. The vertical column separator is
moved left and right on these commands. Use [Space] to repeat the menu.
- For example it works in super panels, including search result panels.
- They are candidates for macros, e.g. for CtrlAltLeft/Right.

*) UI menu: .NET \ Console \ Decrease|Increase font size
- [Space] is used to invoke commands and repeat the menu.

*) Misc
- New property IPanel.ViewPlan - info about column kinds and widths.

*) Bugs
- Native panel state was not restored in some cases.

= 4.4.5 =

*) Explorer arguments
Removed the Panel property. Instead, most of explorer methods are called via
virtual panel methods, so that panels have a chance to do something before or
after. There is also the Parameter property, explorers and callers may use it.

*) Explorer methods
- Renamed a few methods (see the forum discussion)
- AcceptFilesEventArgs: Delete -> ToDeleteFiles

*) Explorers and panels
- Added RenameFile() to rename a file
- Added ExportFiles() to copy/move module files to native destinations
- Super panel supports ExportFiles (actually it depends on explorers of files)

*) Misc
- FarFile class is abstract

= 4.4.4 =

*) File search
- Uses the progress box with some info and [Esc] key stopping the search.
- Results are shown as Name/Owner where Owner values are explorer locations.
- Can be performed in the background with the new switch -Asynchronous of the
Explore module "explore:" command. Results are added to the panel dynamically.
NOTE: Asynchronous mode is very cool but vulnerable, some module panels are not
suitable for this, it all depends on how they and their dependencies work.
- On [Esc] you are prompted to Close or Push the result panel. Push can be done
even if the search process is still in progress. Use the FarNet menu to pop the
panel later (perhaps with more results).
- Added -Depth parameter to the explore: command.

*) Super panel, analogue of the temporary panel

Unlike the temporary panel the super panel deals with files from module panels,
including mixed. It knows how to view / edit / copy / move / delete and etc.
its files because any super file keeps the reference to its source explorer
that actually performs that operations on files, the super panel simply
dispatches operations and files.

It is opened by the empty "explore:" command (i.e. without parameters).

It is also used for search results in both sync and async modes.

*) Opening files (on [Enter])
Added methods OpenFile() and UIOpenFile() to explorer and panels. As a result,
files are opened "as usual" from super/search panels if an explorer can do.

*) ProgressBox
- New properties ElapsedFromShow (used to avoid too frequent shows),
ElapsedFromStart (useful for statistics, performance measurement, etc.)

*) ProgressForm
uses "safe" abort, if possible. The idea/code is from:
http://www.codeproject.com/KB/threads/AbortIfSafe.aspx

= 4.4.3 =

*) Module panel revision, continued

*) Explorer
- Added quite a number of new methods, changed some existing.

*) Panels revision
- All module panels are based on explorers now. A lots of stuff moved to the
Explorer class. To be continued.

*) Panels new
- Method SelectFiles().
- Property SelectionExists.

*) IFar
- FindPanel() ~ one panel -> Panels() ~ all panels

*) Misc
- Error message box: removed [Copy], [More] shows details in the locked editor.

= 4.4.2 =

*) Module panel revision, continued

Experimental search command moved to the new module Explore. But the search
core moved to FarNet.Tools - the idea is that any module can make its own
custom search using the tools. There are two consumers so far:
- the FarNet module Explore;
- the Start-FarSearch cmdlet in PowerShellFar.

Corrections/changes/etc. in panels and explorers:
- Renamed OperationModes -> ExplorerModes.
- CanX() methods are replaced with Function flags.
- MakePanel(args) -> CreatePanel(): now it has to create or get null.
- Removed SetupPanel() as redundant, CreatePanel() should do this job.
- CanImport is used in ExportFileArgs to let the core to [not] lock the editor.
- Panel.DataId is replaced with more flexible FileComparer approach/property.
- IPanel.TempFileExtension -> ExportFileArgs.FileNameExtension (search panel
can now Export/Edit files with the proper extensions + extensions may now be
different for different files).

Explorers/panels have TypeId and ExplorerTypeId - simple way to tell the core
to reuse the panel with several explorers of the same type.

New explorer type/method ExploreLocation - it works with pure paths and files
with no data. Advantage: standard Far search [AltF7] and [F3], [CtrlQ] work.

*) Editor
- IsLocked is settable (before opening, too).

*) Dialog
- IButton.Text - added internal setter (reflection issue).
- Added IControl.Name (not used by the core) in addition to Data.

= 4.4.1 =

Module panel revision, continued
- Fixed a few bugs in the Panel class
- ExplorerResult -> JobResult (to be used elsewhere)
- Panel.UI{View/Edit}CurrentFile -> UI{View/Edit}File
- Added to explorers the DeleteFiles method and its infrastructure

Concept proof: the first version of universal search in explorer panels:
[ShiftF7] (hardcoded so far). There is no dialog yet, it finds all items and
shows them in a new search result panel. [Enter] on found items opens their
original panels as child panels of the search. If an item (its explorer)
supports Export/Import then you can view/edit it in the result panel.

= 4.4.0 =

*** Massive revision of panel API and the first step to "file explorers" ***

All module panels have to be adapted to the new infrastructure.
Modules accessing changed panel members have to be updated, too.

*) Classes and interfaces
- Panel replaces IPanel
- IAnyPanel becomes IPanel (any panel: native, plugin, module)
- Removed IPanelInfo (Info property), its data moved to the class.
- Removed AlternateName from files, it is generated and used internally.

Module panel interface (old IPanel) is combined with the Panel class. The Panel
class (or derived) holds the panel data, event handlers, extra members, etc.
The Host property was removed.

*) New class Explorer
Experimental data provider dealing with FarFile. Explorers are panel helpers
but they can be used without panels for pure data operations including testing.

The PowerShellFar script Test-Explorer-.ps1 shows how various explorers work.

To be continued. All panel methods operating on its virtual file system will be
moved to explorers soon. Panels should be for pure UI classes.

*) Renamed/changed quite a number of lame names/things; just some of them:
- IPanel.Path -> CurrentDirectory
- IPanel.ActivePath -> StartDirectory
- IFar.ActivePath -> CurrentDirectory
- Use*Highlighting -> Highlighting (3 states)
- AddDots -> DotsMode:PanelDotsMode (3 states)
- Some flags were renamed, e.g. related to RealNames mode.
- Events: UpdateFiles, ExportFiles, ImportFiles, MakeDirectory, and
SetPanelDirectory (should set PanelDirectory, not CurrentDirectory).

*) IFar
New method MatchPattern() compatible with the core file masks.

= 4.3.40 =

*) CallPlugin(0xcd, ..) properly opens modal UI and even panels!
CallPlugin supports asynchronous commands (steps and jobs). Asynchronous
commands are suitable for opening dialogs, modal editor/viewers, and even
panels. See Readme.txt for the details, examples, and a known issue, too.

*) IFar
New property MacroArea.

*) ModuleCommandEventArgs
New property MacroArea (instead of IsMacro).

*) IDialog
New property KeepWindowTitle (Far 2.0.1805). As a result, ProgressForm is now
able to show progress information in the console title, as ProgressBox does.

*) Housekeeping (BREAKING if a module is affected)
- Renamed FarMacroState to MacroState ("Far" is rather useless in here);
- PostKeys(, bool), PostText(, bool), PostKeySequence(, bool) - inverted the
second parameter: disableOutput -> enableOutput for consistency with PostMacro,
and Macro.EnableOutput. Also, this follows the rule of "default false". The
change is not breaking but may cause unwanted effects. Review these calls.

*) BUGS
- Fixed a minor issue in Macro.EnableOutput.
- Fixed a multi-threading issue in ProgressForm.
- Fixed an error message on closing a module panel which is opened over a
native plugin panel.

= 4.3.39 =

*) API documentation FarNetAccord.chm
Used the patch for the help builder. There are many fixes. The most important
perhaps is the fix of missing enum value descriptions.

*) ProgressForm
- Removed obsolete SetProgressInt64(). Use SetProgressValue().
- If you use the MultiHasher module: take 0.2.1 or later.

*) IAnyPanel
New property bool CaseSensitiveSort { get; set; }

*) PanelSortMode
New value ChangeTime (~ SM_CHTIME).

*) Revision of the PanelSortMode enum and related panel properties
Added all the same values with the 'Reversed' suffix, e.g. added 'NameReversed'
for 'Name', etc. Thus, all *SortMode properties in panels now get/set the sort
mode and direction in one shot. This approach seems to be easy, intuitive, and
helps to avoid some mistakes. This change is breaking if a module uses removed
*ReverseSortOrder properties.

= 4.3.38 =

*) IFar.Message
New option Draw to draw message-like boxes.

*) IFar.UI (IUserInterface)
New method Draw(): actually draws the job done by DrawColor & DrawPalette
(it's more natural than also working DrawXXX(.., null)).

*) New interface FarNet.Tools.IProgress.

*) New class FarNet.Tools.ProgressBox : IProgress
Draws a simple message box with progress information.
PSF script Test-ProgressForm-.ps1 shows how to use it.

*) ProgressForm implements IProgress
- SetProgressValue() now works with double's, not int's.
- SetProgressInt64() is OBSOLETE AND WILL BE REMOVED.

Modules with ProgressForm:
- Multihasher should work fine;
- FolderChart has to be updated;
- Rebuild other (personal) modules.

*) ProgressBox & ProgressForm
Support of multi-line text (see LineCount).

= 4.3.37 =

*) MODULE COMMANDS AND MACROS
If a FarNet module provides commands invoked by prefixes then these commands
can be called from macros by CallPlugin(). The first argument is the FarNet
system ID: 0xcd. The second argument is the module prefix and command.

Example (RightControl and PowerShellFar commands):

	CallPlugin(0xcd, "RightControl:step-left")
	CallPlugin(0xcd, ">: Menu-Favorites-.ps1")

Mnemonic for 0xcd: eXecute CommanD

*) Search in FarNet panels
Search by name pattern and F3/CtrlQ on folders work. Note that module panels
should do this properly. E.g. built-in PSF panels do not support this, yet.

*) IEditor, IPanel, IDialog
Property object Data {get;set;} is replaced with Hashtable Data {get;}. This
change allows more than one user to attach data without conflicts. Table keys
should be unique, indeed (e.g. a unique reference, Guid, etc.).

*) IFar
Removed the Run method. Use more effective way: GetModuleCommand + Invoke.

*) ModuleCommandEventArgs
New property IsMacro tells that a command is invoked via CallPlugin().
New property Ignore to tell it is not done (e.g. to use another way).

= 4.3.36 =

*) IEditor
Added yet missed property IsVirtualSpace (EOPT_CURSORBEYONDEOL in Far API).

*) IAnyPanel
New method SelectedIndexes().

*) Shelve/Unshelve FarNet panels
These actions use SelectedIndexes() and keep/restore selection by indexes, not
names. This is more effective and allows to restore selection with same names
(rare but still possible use case, e.g. process list). NB: Push/Pop of native
panels still use names because indexes might change if files changed.

= 4.3.35 =

*) IEditor.KeyCount
Corrected to count actual changes. (Reminder: it is not for public use)

= 4.3.34 =

*) x64: Fixed crashes in dialogs. Thanks to signatov2000.

*) IEditor.KeyCount
It is mostly designed for the Vessel module, not for public use. Most of not
significant keys are excluded (navigation, Ctrl and Alt combinations, etc.)

= 4.3.33 =

*) Menu	Console...
Commands Decrease/Increase font size: this feature works only in Windows Vista
and above. But it should not make problems in XP.

*) MouseWheel event in editor
It turns out this event is  not yet supported by Far API. The issue is being
investigated, the event is not removed from FarNet but it does not work.

= 4.3.32 =

*) .NET menu
-- All panel menu commands and items moved to the new sub-menu "Panels...".
-- Added the sub menu "Console...". There are two commands there: decrease and
increase console font size. This menu is available in all menus F11\.NET

Example mouse macros for the Common area:
-- CtrlMsWheelDown (FarNet: Decrease font size):
F11 $If (Menu.Select(".NET", 2) > 0) Enter c d $End
-- CtrlMsWheelUp (FarNet: Increase font size):
F11 $If (Menu.Select(".NET", 2) > 0) Enter c i $End

Notes:
-- increasing fonts too much leads to appearance of the console scroll bars;
-- some fonts are not suitable for this kind of interactive resizing.

*) IEditor
-- SetText() now drops selection, if any; this way looks more intuitive.
-- Fixed GetSelectedText() for column kind of selection.

*) MouseInfo
-- New property Value (wheel value for the MouseWheel event). Note: MouseWheel
event works in Far 2.0.1756+

*) IListMenu
Fixed the permanent filter.

= 4.3.31 =

*) UI: new .NET menu items
Added two new menu items "Editors..." and "Viewers..." that show the editor or
viewer list sorted by recent activity. This is experimental but it looks like a
useful addition to the native Far menu Screens.

*) Editor & Viewer
-- New methods Activate() to make the instance window active.
-- Improved internal management of editor and viewer lists. Useful side effect:
IFar methods Editors() and Viewers() return instances sorted by last activity.

*) IEditor
-- New properties KeyCount, TimeOfOpen, TimeOfSave (for statistics, AI, etc.)
-- Changed Save(): it saves only on changes. This is shorter than often used
"if (!editor.IsSaved) Save();" and helps to avoid misuse of the IsModified.
-- New method Save(bool) allows to save even not changed file.

NB: change of Save() is unlikely breaking but you may want to review your calls
and remove not needed checks.

*) IViewer
-- New property TimeOfOpen (similar to IEditor).

= 4.3.30 =

*) IEditor
-- New property Bookmark gets the bookmark operator.
-- Method Bookmarks() moved to the IEditorBookmark.

*) New interface IEditorBookmark
Operates on the standard and stack (new!) editor bookmarks.

*) Exceptions on Far call failures
InvalidOperationException is used for internal issues, e.g. Far call failures,
instead of OperationCanceledException. Modules may be affected if they used to
catch/check OperationCanceledException.

NB: for correct work with bookmarks use Far 2.0.1667+

= 4.3.29 =

*) Far.Net.UI
New method SetProgressFlash() (Far 2.0.1660, ACTL_PROGRESSNOTIFY).

*) FarNet.Tools.ProgressForm
The progress form calls SetProgressFlash() after show. As a result, such
modules as FolderChart, MultiHasher have this new feature automatically.
NB: the toolbar icon flashes only if the window is not active.

*) IDialog
Fixed work of the TypeId property for native Far dialogs.

= 4.3.28 =

*) IEdit, IComboBox
Added property IsTouched (~ DM_EDITUNCHANGEDFLAG).

*) New interface IEditable
IEdit and IComboBox now share the same base interface IEditable.
(It's unlikely breaking, but probability is not zero)

= 4.3.27 =

*) FarNet.Tools.ProgressForm
-- New helper method SetProgressInt64() for long integer values.
-- New method Invoke() invokes the specified job action delegate in a new
thread. This is a simple scenario with optional job thread abortion.
-- New features were tried/tested in the MultiHasher module and will be
proposed to the author. Watch the MultiHasher announcements.

= 4.3.26 =

*) New utility library FarNet.Tools.dll (and its FarNet.Tools.xml)
It will contain tools that are not FarNet API or Far Manager API but extra
FarNet utilities designed for all modules. If a module uses these tools then
FarNet.Tools.dll should be added to its references together with FarNet.dll.
-- moved SubsetForm from FarNet to FarNet.Tools;
-- added new utility form ProgressForm; examples: Test-ProgressForm-.ps1 in
PowerShellFar and the separately distributed module FolderChart.

*) Utility forms moved from FarNet to FarNet.Tools
-- removed IFar.CreateSubsetForm() method;
-- removed interfaces IForm and ISubsetForm.

*) Documentation
-- Added documentation of new FarNet.Tools types.
-- Improved index panel: added sub-indexes for types, joined indexes for
members with same names + full names view in the "Topics found" dialog.

= 4.3.25 =

*) IEditor
-- Very good news: workaround methods BeginAccess/EndAccess for faster line
iterations are not needed anymore (Far 2.1623+) and removed. Breaking change,
modules using them should be updated.
-- If EditorKit module is used then it has to be rebuilt.

*) Documentation
-- It is adapted for and built by the latest Sandcastle. Documentation style is
changed from "Prototype" to "VS2005" because "Prototype" is declared obsolete.
("VS2005" style is better, basically)

= 4.3.23 =

*) Update-FarNet.ps1 (new script for selective update of FarNet packages)
http://farnet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/PowerShellFar/Bench/Update-FarNet.ps1

Its goal is selective update of various FarNet packages. In particular it
updates FarNet. You may skip any packages.

You can download the script directly from the above URL (do not forget to
unblock the script) or take it together with the PowerShellFar package.

*) Raw UI
Minor changes and fixes.

= 4.3.22 =

*) Raw UI methods moved to a separate interface
-- Renamed recently added property IFar.RawUI to UI.
-- Added a few UI members to hide direct calls to System.Console.
-- Moved raw UI members from IFar to IFar.UI: DrawColor, DrawPalette,
GetPaletteBackground, GetPaletteForeground, MainWindowHandle, RestoreScreen,
SaveScreen, SaveUserScreen, ShowUserScreen, SetProgressState, SetProgressValue,
Redraw, and Write.

= 4.3.21 =

*) IFar
-- New property RawUI.

*) IRawUI
-- Low level UI operator; properties so far: WindowCursor, WindowPlace
(Far 2.0.1573: ACTL_GETFARRECT, ACTL_GETCURSORPOS, ACTL_SETCURSORPOS).

= 4.3.20 =

*) Renamed documentation
Renamed PowerShellFar.chm to FarNetAccord.chm. It includes PowerShellFar API
but it is about FarNet in the first place, so the new name is less confusing.

*) IButton
-- fix: .Text should return the real text, i.e. without brackets.

*) Module configuration
-- fixes in editor and filer module config tools.

*) Misc
-- fix of console colors of error messages on exit.

= 4.3.19 =

Internal changes dealing with the user screen operations. Automatic calls of
SaveUserScreen before showing Far UI after ShowUserScreen and console writing.
NOTE: direct use of these methods and console writing is not recommended.

IFar
Renamed WriteText and WritePalette to DrawColor and DrawPalette in order to
distinguish them from low level Write* methods. In contrast to Write* family
Draw* methods are for normal use, for example for custom dialog controls.

= 4.3.18 =

New module cache approach
-- It is fine to use several Far or FarNet locations with different sets of
modules or even different versions. Cache conflicts are resolved now.
-- Theoretically new way of caching should work slightly faster because some
housekeeping procedures are not performed.
But:
-- There is no automatic cache cleaning now. The cache may contain entries not
used any more. It is recommended to remove the cache manually periodically, in
particular after removing\moving\renaming modules and Far\FarNet locations:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Far2\Plugins\FarNet\!Cache

Renamed confusing names
IFar.GetUserScreen -> ShowUserScreen
IFar.SetUserScreen -> SaveUserScreen
These methods are "low level" and it is very unlikely that many modules use
them. Still, if a module calls them then this change is breaking, indeed.

= 4.3.17 =

Tracing (configured via Far.exe.config or dynamically)
-- Internal FarNet tracing uses newer TraceSource tools instead of older Trace.
-- "Far.exe.config" enables the source "FarNet" with the switch "FarNet.Trace".
The default switch level is "Warning". Do not forget to update the config file
(or merge with your changes) to make sure that new tracing works.
-- The trace listener writing to the file "C:\Far.exe.trace.log" is disabled in
the distributed config file. Practice shows that it is useful only in special
cases. In that cases this or other listeners should be added and configured.
Alternatively, tracing can be watched by the Sysinternals utility DbgView.exe
or in the attached debugger if any is available.

= 4.3.16 =

IEditor
-- Removed the workaround method ChangeTitle because Mantis 1334 was recently
resolved: the property .Title now changes the title permanently, null or empty
string restores the original title.

Module EditorKit
The module TrimSaving is replaced with a new module EditorKit. It contains:
-- TrimSaving (old) - trims line ends on saving;
-- ExpandTabsAll (new) - sets tabs expansion mode to 'All' for some files.
Notes:
-- Reminder: file types are configurable via FarNet configuration UI.
-- You may want to remove or rename this registry key:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Far2\Plugins\FarNet\TrimSaving.dll

= 4.3.15 =

IDialog
-- New property IEnumerable<IControl> Controls
-- Breaking change: GetControl is replaced with the indexer [int]

IEditor
-- New method ChangeTitle: changes the title permanently.
This API may be changed or removed depending on Mantis 1334.

= 4.3.13 =

Technical build with some changes in the API documentation.

= 4.3.12 =

MASSIVE REVISION OF EDITOR AND EDITOR LINES
(breaking for modules working with editors)

As it was mentioned at the forum some time ago, API of editor and edit lines is
revised in this version. There are many changes, they are not listed in here,
everything is explained in the API documentation. Just two words: basic stuff
and principles are the same. But some "too smart" and practically not really
useful features were cut off. Some names were changed to be more informative.

Also, key and mouse events are split up: OnKey -> KeyDown, KeyUp; OnMouse ->
MouseClick, MouseDoubleClick, MouseMove, MouseWheel. Thus, now in many cases
handlers do not have to check event kinds.

NEW PANELS FEATURES
(new in Far API)

*) New property DirectoriesFirst (bool) ~ new sorting mode
*) New PanelSortMode values: StreamCount, StreamSize, FullName

OTHER CHANGES

Included two more internal .NET assemblies into the FarNet package.

= 4.3.11 =

Changes are mostly internal, important for the future. They are not breaking if
modules do not use something not recommended.

FarNet host configuration: some settings in "Far.exe.config" are replaced with
environment variables, see Readme.txt for details. But normally you should use
default settings.

New DLLs are included into the FarNet package: FarNet.Works.*.dll. They contain
pure .NET host independent internal tools. They should not be used by modules
directly. They are used only by the FarNet host (actual Far plugin). In the
future they will be used by other FarNet hosts.

Some public API was extended. This should not affect modules and they should
not use it (marked "for internal use").

Related internal change: renamed namespace FarNet.Support into FarNet.Works; it
contains internal FarNet stuff that should not be used by modules.

= 4.3.10 =

ACTION GUID

Guid attribute is now mandatory for module action classes (tools, commands,
editors, filers). Generate it, do not copy\paste it from some sample code :).

At the same time Guid attribute is not required for module host classes. It is
not an error to set it, it is just not used by FarNet. Each module host is well
identified by its module name, because module names have to be unique.

PANEL KEY PROCESSING

Preprocessing of panel keys is now done by the new event IPanel.KeyPressing.
As a result:
1) Event IPanel.KeyPressed is not called on this, KeyPressing is called;
2) Flag PanelKeyEventArgs.Preprocess was removed, it is not needed now.

Also, some mysterious and\or annoying pseudo key events are filtered out
internally and panel key events are not called (e.g. KEY_NONE, KEY_IDLE,
KEY_KILLFOCUS, KEY_GOTFOCUS - some of them are not documented in Far API).

This change is breaking for panels using PanelKeyEventArgs.Preprocess. But it
makes processing of IPanel.KeyPressed simpler because in most cases panels are
not interested in preprocessing events. Thus, panels do not have to filter out
noise of preprocessing keys and pseudo keys.

Just in case, [e]Bu$ter's module "Windows7.Libraries" should work fine.

MINOR CHANGES

FarNet module tool config: minor issue: if a new version of an installed module
tool adds new menu areas then items may be not shown there by default if a user
had already modified the tool configuration. Fixed for new modules to come. Old
module tool settings may be updated manually when needed.

IFar: removed method ShowPanelMenu(), it is unlikely ever needed for modules.

Internal: improved management of editor opening events.

= 4.3.9 =

Fixed a few configuration bugs of FarNet 4.3.8.

Disk menu: show just tool names with no .NET prefix and hotkeys.

Tutorial-Host sample module: used Options=AllAreas, for demo and testing sake.

= 4.3.8 =

FarNet configuration dialog for a module tool allows to set a hotkey for the
.NET menus (as usual) and to disable\enable the default areas where the tool
menu items are shown (new feature). As a result, normally modules should not
care of these configuration settings, they are common for all modules and
configured by the core.

= 4.3.7 =

PROGRESS

*) Modules with dynamically added actions do not have to unregister them on
disconnection: they are unregistered automatically.

*) IMacro: added support for Consts and Vars areas.

*) Optimized module loading, unloading, caching.

*) Fixed crash on incorrect use of a listbox.

REFACTORING, BREAKING FOR SOME MODULES

*) Abstract registry access:
-- Removed properties IFar .RegistryFarPath, .RegistryPluginsPath.
-- Modules should not operate on the registry directly (though they can, of
course). They should access data via IRegistryKey returned by OpenRegistryKey()
of IModuleManager (normally) or IFar (only when really needed).
-- For Far Manager IRegistryKey works with the Windows registry, it is the
wrapper of Microsoft.Win32.RegistryKey. But modules should not rely on this.

*) IFar: window members moved to the operator:
Members GetWindowInfo, GetWindowType, SetCurrentWindow, WindowCount, and
WindowType moved to new window operator IFar.Window (and names adapted).

*) Type -> Kind:
The word 'Type' is replaced with 'Kind' in most cases. 'Type' should deal with
.NET System.Type class only. This change should reduce confusions and fix some
code analysis issues.
Renamed:
-- WindowType -> WindowKind, Type -> Kind, TypeName -> KindName
-- SelectionType -> RegionKind (and used more general 'Region')
-- FarColumn, SetColumn: Type -> Kind
-- ISelection.Type -> Kind
-- PanelType -> PanelKind
-- IAnyPanel.Type -> Kind

= 4.3.6 =

UPDATE STEPS

Remove the registry key "Far2\Plugins\FarNet" and make sure you do not start
old FarNet after that, otherwise you will get never used FarNet registry data.

MAIN CHANGES

*) All module items (actions and hosts) should have a Guid attribute. Generate
it once for each class or registered action and never change. But you can now
use any class or action names and change them as you want: registry data will
not be affected. All sample modules use these GUIDs.

*) Module actions: new attribute property Resources. If it is true the property
Name is the name of a resource string from the module .resources files.

*) All Register*\Unregister* methods moved from IFar to IModuleManager.

*) IFar: new methods GetModuleCommand, GetModuleFiler, GetModuleTool allow to
call an action of any module (loaded or not yet) from any other module.

*) Configuration menus and dialogs were changed a little bit. For tools we now
can set internal hotkeys (do not use standard Far hotkeys!). This is temporary,
hopefully Far will use GUIDs for menus, then module items will be able to use
standard Far hotkeys.

OTHER CHANGES

*) IControl: new property Data: user data (for FarNet controls only).

*) IAnyPanel: new method UnselectNames(), opposite to SelectNames().

*) Recommendation: how modules should keep their settings. IFar: removed
methods GetPluginValue(), SetPluginValue(), this place is not for modules.
Use new IModuleManager.OpenSubKey().

= 4.3.5 =

MAJOR ARCHITECTURE CHANGES

*) Module tool classes:
-- Module tool class instance is created for each call of its Invoke() method.
-- Virtual Connect()\Disconnect() are removed. Use ModuleHost if you need them.
-- Virtual properties are replaced with class attributes, see documentation and
sample modules. Each class has its own attribute class: e.g. ModuleXyzAttribute
for ModuleXyz class.
-- Attributes are mandatory. Empty ("default") names are not allowed any more.

*) Simplified access to IFar host. It is now 'Far.Net' anywhere. In your code:
-- Module classes: replace 'Far.' with 'Far.Net.';
-- Other code: you do not have to think of exposing IFar (e.g. sending it to
constructors or keeping it in a static variable), just use 'Far.Net' anywhere.

*) Simplified module manifest files (.cfg), see Readme.txt if you use them.

*) A few renamings, e.g. ToolOptions -> ModuleToolOptions, CommandEventArgs ->
ModuleCommandEventArgs, etc. New names describe themselves better.

*) These changes are breaking, indeed, and the modules should be updated.
If you have problems on loading after update try to drop the cache:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Far2\Plugins\FarNet\<cache>

MINOR RELATED CHANGES

*) For a menu tool default Options value changed from 'AllMenus' to 'None'.
Thus, it is mandatory to specify Options, otherwise an item is not shown:
[ModuleTool(Name = "Hello", Options = ModuleToolOptions.Panels)]

*) Invoke() in some module tools: sender is null now, not IFar instance. It is
useless to send IFar because it is available as Far.Net anywhere.

*) Sample module Tutorial-Tool is replaced with Tutorial-Host. It still
contains the same sample module tool and a sample module host is added.
This host is not preloadable. Example of preloadable host is PSF.

OTHER CHANGES

*) IEditor: options WordDiv, ShowWhiteSpace, WriteByteOrderMark can be set
before (new!) or after opening the editor.

*) PanelModeInfo: new properties IsAlignedExtensions, IsCaseConversion.

= 4.3.4 =

*) [e]Bu$ter fixed a recent bug of FarColumn percentage (negative) widths.

*) IMacro.Check() should start to work correctly in Far 2.0.1386+

= 4.3.3 =

*) Removed the ".NET" item from the disk menu. It is not used. Note: ".NET"
items in F11 menus, even empty, are used internally and cannot be removed.

*) FarColumn, SetColumn: Width changed type from 'string' to 'int':
positive: absolute width; negative: percentage; 0: Far decides.

*) Fix: "event" Invoking() was not always called for module tools.

*) IMacro: new method Check(). Far 2.0.1381+

*) IEditor: new option WriteByteOrderMark. Far 2.0.1384+

*) Tracing: too frequent events moved from mode 3 to 4 (see Far.exe.config).

= 4.3.2 =

CUSTOM COLORS OF DIALOG CONTROLS

New event IControl.Coloring allows to set 1-4 custom colors depending on the
control type. PowerShellFar script Test-Dialog-.ps1 shows a few examples.

= 4.3.1 =

ANNOUNCEMENT

It is discussed and decided that FarNet plugins are not called PLUGINS any more
everywhere: in API, code, documentation. From now on they are called MODULES:
.NET assemblies implementing one or more FarNet MODULE TOOLS.

The folders structure is changed, see Readme.txt or just extract from the
archive to %FARHOME% keeping the structure. Then remove old Lib (it is now
%FARHOME%\FarNet) and Plugins.NET (it is now %FARHOME%\FarNet\Modules).
Do not forget to replace %FARHOME%\Far.exe.config with new one.

TERMINOLOGY: PLUGINS -> MODULES
(breaking name changes)

Module tools:
-- BasePlugin -> BaseModule
-- CommandPlugin -> ModuleCommand
-- EditorPlugin -> ModuleEditor
-- FilerPlugin -> ModuleFiler
-- ToolPlugin -> ModuleTool
-- PluginException -> ModuleException

Interfaces:
-- IPanel -> IAnyPanel (rename it first, before IPluginPanel -> IPanel)
-- IPluginPanel -> IPanel (rename it second, after IPanel -> IAnyPanel)
-- IPluginPanelInfo -> IPanelInfo

Members:
-- GetPluginPanel() -> FindPanel()
-- CreatePluginPanel() -> CreatePanel()

Let's also fix wrong names and bad names:
-- EnvExpanded -> ExpandEnvironmentVariables
-- Eol -> EndOfLine
-- HWnd -> MainWindowHandle
-- Msg -> Message
-- NoSmartCoords -> NoSmartCoordinates
-- RootFar -> RegistryFarPath
-- RootKey -> RegistryPluginsPath
-- StartSortDesc -> StartReverseSortOrder
-- UseAttrHighlighting -> UseAttributeHighlighting

Let's also fix one confusing feature:
-- InputBox.NoLastHistory -> UseLastHistory
a) to have the same name as the property of IEdit
b) because by default it should be "don't use" (the least surprise)

OTHER CHANGES

*) Macros:
-- IMacro.GetNames(): fixed exceptions on missed areas.
-- Macro.Area type changed from string to enum MacroArea.
-- IMacro methods use the enum MacroArea.
-- API changes: see documentation.

*) Issue _090208_042536. IBaseList: removed the obsolete workaround method
.Clear(). Instead, the method .Items.Clear() should be used. If it still has
problems, report, it will be restored ASAP. (It was a bug in PowerShell that
looks fixed in V2 RTM).

= 4.3.0 =

NEW VERSION NUMBER

Version number moves forward due to important recent changes:
-- Localization support
-- Quit() and CanExit()
-- MakingDirectory
-- Macros revision
-- Win7 taskbar icon tools
-- GUI message boxes (suitable for special tasks)
-- Revision of panel mode info (more object oriented)
-- Long paths support (note: .NET does not like long file paths)
-- Multiple panels (true for FarNet, saved state for file panels)
-- Async writing mode in editors (including not current editors)
-- Code pages in editors (get\set)
-- More info on exceptions
-- Dialog enhancements

NEW IN THIS VERSION

*) New method IFar.Quit(): Tells Far to quit (Far 2.0.1348 ACTL_QUIT).

*) New virtual method BasePlugin.CanExit() (called by IFar.Quit()).

*) Hopefully the final revision of macros (breaking for using plugins):
-- MacroData is replaced with Macro;
-- IMacro methods updated for new Macro.
The story: unusual IMacro methods with dictionaries were designed for easy use
in PowerShell. End of story: in PowerShell V2 New-Object supports dictionaries
itself, so that IMacro methods now can be natural and simple.

= 4.2.27 =

*) Tweaks in docs and code.

= 4.2.26 =

*) Minor fix in MakingDirectoryEventArgs.

*) Work around "Far does not restore panel state" on menu action .NET \ Close
panel: let's set the top item current before closing.

NEW FEATURES

*) IInputBox:
-- New flag IsPath (~ Far FIB_EDITPATH).

*) IEdit:
-- New flag IsPath (~ Far DIF_EDITPATH).
-- Renamed Password -> IsPassword (to be the same as in IInputBox). Technically
this is a breaking change but it is unlikely used (it is read only in IEdit).

*) FarNet configuration: "UI culture": added [F1] help for the input box.

REFACTORING OF MACROS
(breaking changes for plugins using macros)

-- Renamed interface IKeyMacroHost to IMacro
-- Its methods Post() moved to IFar as PostMacro()
-- Renamed property IFar KeyMacro to Macro
-- Renamed class KeyMacroData to MacroData
-- Internal: the macro operator is created only when requested.

= 4.2.25 =

*) IPluginPanel: it turned out that the event MakingDirectory still was not
quite implemented. Now it is.

*) Far error messages in a panel which is not subscribed to MakingDirectory
on pressing [F7] are fixed.

*) Plugins.NET samples: replaced .bat files with .proj files for MSBuild.exe:
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\MSBuild.exe
Basically "MSBuild" and "projects" are similar to "make" and "makefiles" but
MSBuild is .NET oriented and projects are XML files (see MSDN for details).

Examples:
MSBuild.exe Build.proj (makes default targets, usually "Build")
MSBuild.exe Build.proj /t:Build (makes the target "Build")
MSBuild.exe Build.proj /t:Clean (makes the target "Clean")
MSBuild.exe Build.proj /t:Build;Clean (makes the "Build" and "Clean")

If you use PowerShellFar then the script Start-MSBuild-.ps1 can be used, too.
It helps to choose command line parameters and keeps commands in history.

Even if you develop in Visual Studio, MSBuild tasks still can be useful, for
example you may add custom MSBuild tasks like resource files generation (see
Tutorial-ToolPlugin\Build.proj). See commented out targets "BeforeBuild" and
"AfterBuild" in your Visual Studio project file (.csproj, use text editor).

= 4.2.24 =

PLUGINS LOCALIZATION SUPPORT (continued, see 4.2.23)

*) FarNet configuration menus and dialogs
-- Section "Tools": fixed displayed tool number.
-- Section "Modules": added submenu item "UI culture".
-- Updated the .hlf file.

= 4.2.23 =

PLUGINS LOCALIZATION SUPPORT
(Standard file based resource management in .NET)

*) BasePlugin: localization support:
-- New property CurrentUICulture (normally you should not care but see help).
-- New method GetString() gets localized strings from standard resource files:
PluginBaseName.resources (default, English is recommended)
PluginBaseName.ru.resources (Russian)
PluginBaseName.de.resources (German)
...
Binary .resources files are generated by resgen.exe from trivial .txt\.restext
files or Visual Studio .resx files. Note that resgen.exe allows to decompile
.resources back to .restext or .resx, only original comments are lost.

Yet another way to build resources is MSBuild task GenerateResource.

*) IFar: localization support:
-- New method GetCurrentUICulture() based on %FARLANG%.

*) Plugins.NET\Tutorial-ToolPlugin: shows how to build a localized plugin using
trivial .restext files. Note that Hello.ru.restext translates only language
dependent strings and does not care of others. The .NET resource manager
processes such cases just fine.

WINDOWS 7 TASKBAR ICON

*) IFar: new methods SetProgressState() and SetProgressValue() expose Far API
ACTL_SETPROGRESSSTATE and ACTL_SETPROGRESSVALUE (build 1309).

MISC

*) IFar.TempName() uses changed Far FSF.MkTemp (build 1311).

*) Plugins.NET: it is decided to drop VB and JS samples. Hopefully provided CS
samples should be quite enough: basically all .NET languages are very similar.

= 4.2.22 =

*) IPanel: methods SelectAt(), UnselectAt(): null as input parameter is OK now,
it is simply ignored, just like an empty array.

= 4.2.21 =

*) IPluginPanel: property DataComparison (class Comparison<object>) is replaced
with easier to use and more natural property DataId (delegate Getter). This
change is breaking if your plugins use DataComparison.

= 4.2.20 =

*) IEditor: confusing property name "IsEnd" is changed to "IsLastLine".

*) API code comments and documentation.

= 4.2.19 =

*) Archive structure: files LICENSE and History.txt moved to the plugin folder
"Plugins\FarNet".

= 4.2.18 =

*) Version numbers: as far as FarNet and PowerShellFar are always built and
released together, from now on their version numbers will be the same.

*) FarNet updates: if you use FarNet together with PowerShell then it can be
updated together with PowerShellFar by a script distributed with PowerShellFar.

= 4.2.17 =

*) Added section PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS to the Readme.txt; discribed a rare
problem of loading .NET plugins in x86 Far on x64 machines and a possible
workaround.

*) API code comments and documentation.

= 4.2.16 =

*) Updated API code comments and documentation.

= 4.2.15 =

*** Far 2.0.1238+ ***

*) IEditor: new property ShowWhiteSpace: Gets or sets show white space flag.

*) Internal: more robust IFar.Dialog (current dialog). Note: implemented as
workaround: there is no such Far API, see Mantis 1179.

= 4.2.14 =

*) IFar.Msg() with 'Gui*' options: it is OK to provide 'helpTopic' parameter,
it's not an error, it is simply ignored. Throw only on custom buttoms: they
are not supported in GUI mode.

= 4.2.13 =

*** Far 2.0.1209+ ***

*) Updated IFar.GetDialogHistory() for Far 2.0.1208

= 4.2.12 =

*) Improved view of error messages and stack information shown on exceptions
when you press buttons [View info] and [Copy info] in exception dialogs.

*) Added class PluginException. If a plugin throws exceptions then for better
diagnostics it is recommended to use this or derived from this exceptions.

*) Minor internal tweaks.

= 4.2.11 =

*** Requires Far 2.0.1200+ ***

*) Adapted for Far 2.0.1200 (IEditor.WordDiv).

= 4.2.10 =

REVISION OF PanelModeInfo

*) New abstract class FarColumn and its simple implementation SetColumn. Use
SetColumn to define panel column type, width, and title or status column type
and width.

*) Properties ColumnTitles, ColumnTypes, ColumnWidths are replaced with new
property - array Columns.

*) Properties StatusColumnTypes, StatusColumnWidths are replaced with new
property - array StatusColumns.

New columns definition is perhaps slightly more verbose but it is more object
oriented and safe: with old version incorrect data could crash Far or lead to
displayed garbage. Also, it is now easier to change column options and order
after creation (both in code and at run time).

= 4.2.9 =

*) IFar.Msg(): new MsgOptions flags Gui and GuiOnMacro allow to show standard
Windows GUI message boxes. Do not use these flags without good reasons.

*) Far.exe.config: appSettings: added key FarNet.DisableGui. Allows to disable
GUI message boxes used internally in exceptional cases. Recommended (default)
value is false, i.e. special GUI messages are enabled.

*) For safety sake: avoiding unexpected results on exceptions during a running
macro IFar.ShowError() now stops a macro before showing an error dialog.

= 4.2.8 =

*** Requires Far 2.0.1181+ ***

*) IFar.ActivePath returns the internal Far current directory path. NOTE: this
is not always the same as the IPanel.Path of the active panel.

*) IPanel.GoToPath(): fixed wrong current item for paths ending with a slash.

= 4.2.7 =

*) IFar: property Version is replaced with two properties: FarVersion and
FarNetVersion.

= 4.2.6 =

MULTIPLE PANELS
(true for FarNet panels, simulation for Far file panels)

FarNet plugin panels on closing by Close() restore the original file panel
current and selected items. (Far does not do this itself, see Mantis 1114).

FarNet panel tools (available from the plugin menu) allow to work with multiple
FarNet panels and to simulate work with multiple standard Far file panels. You
can:
-- push any FarNet plugin panel for later use (as usual);
-- shelve any standard Far file panel, i.e. keep its state (new feature!);
-- pop/unshelve previously pushed/shelved panels; the shown panel restores its
state: current and selected items and sort and view modes (new for file panels
+ restoring of selection is new for FarNet plugin panels).

OTHER CHANGES

*) IPanel: new method SelectNames(). It is introduced for *restoring* of the
selection (see above), but it can be used for other selection tasks as well.

*) IFar: removed method PushedPanels(). It is unlikely needed for external use.

*) IPluginPanel: property ActivePath is read only now.

= 4.2.5 =

*) Requires Far 2.0.1160. Event IPluginPanel.PuttingFiles now accepts arguments
as PuttingFilesEventArgs which has additional property Source - source path of
the files being processed. This is not a breaking change, but in Far 2.0.1145+
some operations cannot be performed correctly without this Source information,
such plugins have to be updated.

= 4.2.4 =

*) IEditor: new methods BeginAsync() and EndAsync() allows to write to not a
current editor or from background jobs. Output procedure is similar to console
output. Use this mode very carefully and only when it is absolutely needed.
Plugin PowerShellFar uses this mode for asynchronous editor consoles.

= 4.2.3 =

*) Adapted to Far 2.0.1145+: Far does not set the current directory to the
active panel path (a step to long paths support). Still, remember that .NET
itself and many other external tools do not like long paths. _090929_061740

*) New property IFar.ActivePath: Gets the path of the active Far panel or the
ActivePath (former StartDirectory) of the active FarNet panel. Mind long paths.

*) IEditor.CodePage is now settable after opening, so that it is possible to
change code pages from a plugin. Another good news: Far 2.0.1144+ API works
correctly with code pages on open, save, and save as operations.

= 4.2.2 =

*) IDialog: new event ConsoleSizeChanged ~ DN_RESIZECONSOLE.

*) IDialog: new methods DisableRedraw(), EnableRedraw() ~ DM_ENABLEREDRAW.

*) IDialog: Rect is settable after Show(), too; same as Move() + Resize().

*) IListMenu uses ConsoleSizeChanged to recalculate its size according to the
new console size.

= 4.2.1 =

*) IEditor: new method TextWriter CreateWriter(): the writer calls Insert*()
internally. It is convenient and efficient for using where a writer is
expected.

*) IEditor: new method InsertChar(): not a big deal (Insert() can do the job)
but it is effectively used by text writers created by CreateWriter().

= 4.2.0 =

----- Major changes -----

4.1.0 introduced classes FarFile and SetFile instead of interface IFile. This
approach looks good. So now 4.2.0 in the same way introduces classes FarItem
and SetItem instead of interface IMenuItem.

Yet another change is replacement of a menu item event OnClick (with ability to
add multiple handlers) with a single handler Click. Practice shows that a
single handler is enough and less confusing.

The changes are breaking, indeed, but it should be really easy to update your
code, please follow the simple steps below:

In your code:
1) replace 'IMenuItem' with 'FarItem'
2) replace 'Far.CreateMenuItem()' with 'new SetItem()'
3) replace adding 'OnClick += ...' with setting 'Click = ...'

----- Other changes -----

*) IMenu: added still missed property ChangeConsoleTitle.

*) IFar: improved PostJob; it collects all posted handlers (excluding dupes);
then they are all invoked in the order they were posted.

*) IPanel: new method GoToName(string, bool) in addition to GoToName(string).
New one returns success flag or may optionally throw if a name is not found.

*) IPluginPanelInfo: renamed too general name Format into FormatName.

= 4.1.11 =

*) Fix: IPluginPanel.ShownList used to return null instead of a "dots" file.

*) Added property GettingFilesEventArgs.Names needed in rare cases when auto
alternate names are used.

= 4.1.10 =

*) Fix: Menu: item event handler should not be triggered on a break key.

= 4.1.9 =

*) Fixed not restored parent panel current item on exit from a child panel
which view mode is different from parent.

*) New property IPluginPanelInfo.AutoAlternateNames: Tells to generate
AlternateName value in plugin panel files automatically.

*) Property IPluginPanel.Files is now get/set, you can set any IList<FarFile>
instead of refilling the existing list instance.

= 4.1.8 =

*) New utility interface ISubsetForm - Dialog for selecting a subset of items.
Create it by IFar.CreateSubsetForm(), set its Items and initial selected
Indexes, call Show(), get result selected Indexes. To be continued.

*) IDialog.MouseClicked is now also called if a control does not process this
event (same as for KeyPressed event).

*) IDialog. New property TypeId. Implemented recently added related Far API:
DN_GETDIALOGINFO, DM_GETDIALOGINFO.

*) Fixed not shown panel data of a child panel which view mode is different
from parent panel view mode. New code is also more optimal.

= 4.1.7 =

*) IPanel. New methods SelectAt, UnselectAt, SelectAll, UnselectAll.

*) IPanel. New properties ShownList and SelectedList. They are similar to
ShownFiles and SelectedFiles, but not always the same and work dynamically,
i.e. return only really accessed items. Note that ShownFiles now does not
return ".." item, if you need this item then use new ShownList instead.

*) IPluginPanel. Property Id is renamed into TypeId.

*) Internal. Changed memory management for panel items. As a result, reduced
"out-of-memory" chances for panels with extremely large number of items.

= 4.1.6 =

*) IEditor. New methods BeginUndo(), EndUndo(), Undo(), Redo(). Note: they
implement new Far API.

*) IEditor::SetText is now atomic for Undo\Redo.

*) IFar. New method PostJob() - posts a handler to be invoked in the Far main
thread when Far gets control. Note: it implements new Far API. Note: test only
so far.

INTERNAL
- Removed workaround in Editor::SetText (missed the first empty line of the
first output), the editor looks working fine in the latest Far.

= 4.1.5 =

Updated for Far 2.0.997 (breaking changes in Far Editor and Window API)

= 4.1.4 =

Updated for Far 2.0.992 (breaking changes in Far Dialog API)

CUSTOM PANEL COLUMNS

At last FarNet supports custom user panel columns. Use FarFile.Columns,
SetFile.Columns. Custom columns are very easy: property Columns is any
collection of any objects. See also FarNet.PanelModeInfo: use C0-C9 in
ColumnTypes and StatusColumnTypes.

= 4.1.3 =

*) Fixed plugin calls from the disk menu.

*) IAnyEditor
Added new event Idled, as usual, triggered periodically when a user is idle.
Event OnKey is not triggered with VirtualKeyCode = 0 any more, plugins should
use new event Idled for this case. This change makes handlers more natural and
also improves performance: OnKey is relatively expensive and called not often
now, Idled is cheap (event itself, actual cost depends on handlers, of course).

*) New class IdledHandler
It is a helper for Idled events. Idled events may be called too frequently for
a particular task. In this case use IdledHandler.Create to get a handler with a
custom call frequency.

*) Forms.IDialog.Idled changed from EventHandler<AnyEventArgs> to the simple
EventHandler for 2 reasons: a) arguments were not used anyway; b) to follow
common Idled events scheme, which allows use of IdledHandler, for example.

= 4.1.1 =

*) IEditor.CodePage for the opened editor works now (read only).

*) As it was announced, two obsolete methods IFar.CreatePanelItem() were
removed. Plugins should create instances of SetFile directly by 'new' or they
can use custom files derived from FarFile.

*) Build. Directory FarNetMan\Headers.c is removed. The FarNetMan expects it in
here: "C:\Program Files\Far\PluginSDK\Headers.c". If this is not a case then
project include directories should be corrected.

= 4.1.0 =

MAJOR CHANGES

*) Interface 'IFile' is replaced with abstract class 'FarFile'. This approach
is more convenient for plugins that use custom implementation of files. Also,
though it is less important, it provides slightly faster access to members.
WARNING: this change is breaking, but technically in almost 100% cases you
simply just have to replace the name IFile with FarFile everywhere.

*) FarNet provides ready to use implementation of 'FarFile': class 'SetFile'.
Instances of this class can be created directly by 'new'. That is why two
methods IFar.CreatePanelItem() are not needed now; they are attributed
'Obsolete' and will be removed in the next version.

OTHER CHANGES

*) Reviewed and improved (hopefully) tracing of errors. IFar.ShowError() now
traces errors, too, so that if a plugin calls this function then error info is
sent to trace listeners. Reminder: see "Far.exe.config" for tracing options.

= 4.0.13 =

TRACING

*) FarNet core supports standard .NET tracing mechanism. It is customized in
"Far.exe.config", take a look at comments there and customize it for yourself.

*) A default listener (added in machine .config) outputs to a debugger, so that
FarNet plugin debugging may be easier. Trace levels 3 and 4 (see below) can be
slow with a debugger; in this case you can remove default listeners by <clear/>
and still use a fast file writer added by <add ... />.

*) Removed option FarNet.StartupErrorDialog from "Far.exe.config" - critical
startup errors are written to the console and optionally traced now. Modal
dialogs should not be shown on loading.

*) Most important calls Far <-> FarNet <-> FarNetPlugin are already traced.
More tracing, especially FarNet <-> FarNetPlugin will be introduced later.

TRACING TIPS

1) Switch 'FarNet.Trace' defines 5 levels of tracing (0:Off ... 4:Verbose);
recommended level is 2:Warning - to trace errors and warnings, if any. Note:
they normally show plugins or system issues, not FarNet itself.

2) You can add more trace listeners, for example a log file writer; one is
added in "Far.exe.config". Remove it or change it as needed.

3) Your plugin can call System.Diagnostics.Trace methods itself. 'FarNet.Trace'
does not affect your tracing unless you use it directly (see TraceSwitch, MSDN).

4) Tracing is a standard .NET feature, see MSDN for details about tracing and
configuration files - there are many useful titbits for free there.

5) Do not be tempted to use tracing for normal data output. Tracing is for
diagnostics and troubleshooting.

MISC

*) Renamed namespace FarNet.Raw into FarNet.Support; it contains supportive
features that normally should not be used from user code.

*) Internal FarNet menu commands are processed more effectively.

= 4.0.12 =

PLUGIN PANEL VIEW MODES
(in progress, subject to change)

*) New .NET menu item "Switch full screen" allows to switch "full screen"
mode for any view mode of any FarNet panel. So that you may actually have
20 modes = 10 as usual + 10 the same but with switched "full screen".

*) PanelModeInfo - new method Clone() for shallow copy. It is useful for
creation of similar modes with a few differences.

*) IPluginPanelInfo - replaced property Modes (array of all modes) with two
methods GetMode() and SetMode() (they work only for one mode).

OTHER CHANGES

*) ControlKeyStates, KeyInfo and MouseInfo: obsolete not standard name
AltCtrlShift was replaced with classic name CtrlAltShift.

= 4.0.11 =

*) New. PanelModeInfo and IPluginPanelInfo.Modes are used for setting plugin
panel view modes (column types, widths, titles, status line and etc.). To be
continued, remarks are welcome.

*) Implemented processing of IFile.Owner for plugin panels. It can be used as
a custom column (with proper view mode and column titles, see above).

*) IFar.GetHistory() - adapted to recent Far Manger registry history changes.

*) IMenuItem - new properties Grayed, Hidden (new in Far API).

*) PaletteColor - added new values (new in Far API).

*) ControlKeyStates, KeyInfo and MouseInfo: AltCtrlShift is set obsolete (not
standard name) and will be removed soon. Use classic CtrlAltShift instead.

= 4.0.10 =

*) ISelection - new method SelectAll() selects all text in the editor. It is
a helper, you can do the same by Select() with proper parameters.

*) IViewer.CodePage for the opened viewer works now (read only).

*) IFar.CodeToChar() fixed old ANSI approach.

= 4.0.9 =

*) IFar.Write - fixed Unicode output (some characters were written as '?').
Lesson to learn: avoid Console.Write* methods in FarNet and its plugins.

= 4.0.8 =

*) IPluginPanel. New event Escaping. It is triggered when [Escape] is pressed
and the command line is empty. Basically it only helps to use [Escape] key for
closing a panel (or other action). There is no default action, perhaps it will
be added later, suggestions are welcome.

*) As far as IFar.GetWindowType(-1) is used quite frequently, a new property
IFar.WindowType is introduced: it gets a type of the current Far window:
Panels, Dialog, Editor and etc.

*) Undone stepping mode optimization because of problems for command, tool and
filer plugins dynamically registered during stepping.

*) IFar.PostStepAfterStep - fixed a subtle issue: when the first step throws an
error then the second should not be invoked even if it has been already posted.

*) Dialog controls. Improved some code originally designed in Far/1 and not
effective in Far/2.

= 4.0.7 =

*) IListMenu
- New property NoInfo: Do not show item count information at the bottom line.
- Fix. If a key handler is available and called then a standard handler, if
any, should not be called.

= 4.0.6 =

*) x64 support: FarNetMan.dll for x64 Far Manager should be copied from
Plugins.x64\FarNet. (NOTE: the build contains both x86 and x64 versions,
only FarNetMan.dll depends on a platform, FarNet.dll does not).

*) Optimized performance of stepping mechanism (IFar.PostStepXXX methods).

*) Experimental low level UI types were moved to FarNet.Raw namespace.

= 4.0.5 =

*) New IFar methods PostStepAfterKeys() and PostStepAfterStep(). This is a very
important achievement for "super-macros" that can be used now also with modal UI.
See PowerShellFar History.txt for more details.

*) Mantis #730 - thanks to DrKnS, the problem is fixed for list-boxes in Far
2.0.812, so that list-boxes can be used as normal. Other problems still exist
for combo-edit and combo-list; workaround: when a dialog has started do not use
Clear() and then Insert() without detaching and attaching items.

*) ViewFrame.LeftPos - changed from 'int' to 'long', as it is in Far API.

= 4.0.4 =

MAIN CHANGES

*) FarNet is adapted to new Far panel API in 2.0.789. Of course .NET plugins
should not care about it.

*) For technical reasons FarNet is built by Visual Studio 2008 SP1 and FarNet
C++/CLI depends on VS runtime modules. If you do not have VS 2008 then you may
have to google, download and install one of the redistributable packages:
- Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86)
- Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package (x64)

OTHER CHANGES

*) IAnyViewer.ViewText() - switching to editor is enabled. For now if you
switch by [F6] to editor then on exit you see "The file ... was moved or
deleted. [Save]...". It is not a perfect solution perhaps but it is just
useful. If you do not like it, do not switch. Better ideas are welcome.

*) New interface IRawUI and property in IFar, TEST ONLY, they are experimental
and perhaps will be removed.

= 4.0.3 =

*) Property IListBox.Bottom - it was runtime only, now it is standard: as
usual, you can set it before opening a dialog.

*) New overloaded IFar.GetHistory() with extra parameter 'filter' returns
history strings by type(s).

*) It turned out that it is possible to unload FarNet abnormally, for example
by 'unloadp' FAR command or by some plugin manager. This scenario is not
recommended but some changes still were done for avoiding problems.

= 4.0.2 =

*) Improved exchange of strings between .NET and FAR. Note that now in some
cases FarNet is less tolerant to null input strings where text is expected.

*) Dialogs: fixed a few FAR 1 to 2 issues, fixed memory leaks in list controls
on dynamic operations on items, asked to implement IListBox.Title so that it
should work now, added new property IListBox.Bottom, etc.

*) Fixed order of history strings returned by IFar.GetHistory().

*) Wish: allow to "unload" FarNet. Note: DLLs are not physically unloaded. It
is OK to call ExitFARW several times, the first call terminates FarNet. Then it
is safe to call GetPluginInfoW, FarNet simply returns "nothing". Other exported
functions must not be called. STILL, THIS SCENARIO IS NOT RECOMMENDED. Besides,
perhaps some FarNet sub-plugins were not designed for "half-termination".

*) Issue: http://bugs.farmanager.com/view.php?id=730
Do not make dialog list controls empty directly when a dialog is running. Use
this way: DetachItems(), Clear() or RemoveAt(), add items, AttachItems().

= 4.0.1 =

*) Due to a bug in FarNet multiarc plugin did not work. Fixed.

*) FilerEventArgs: new property OperationModes Mode. Unfortunately it is not
yet clear how to use it, you may only experiment for now.

= 4.0.0 =

ANNOUNCEMENT

From now on FarNet 4.x is for Far 2.x. FarNet 3.x is officially not supported.
Theoretically it is possible to use both FarNet 3.x and 4.x in Far 2.x at the
same time but this scenario is not supported, not tested and not recommended.

This is the first and mostly technical phase of transition from Far 1.x to 2.x.
Next FarNet version will use new Far API more effectively.

INSTALLATION

If you did not use FarNet 3.x in Far 2.x then simply do what Readme.txt says;
do read it again even if you read it before: some default names are changed.

If you use or used FarNet 3.x in Far 2.x then do in this order:

1) Remove all(!) installed files of FarNet and .NET plugins.

2) If you want to migrate old settings then rename in the registry:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Far2\PluginHotkeys:
rename key "Plugins/FAR.NET/FarNetPlugin.dll" into "Plugins/FarNet/FarNetMan.dll"
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Far2\Plugins:
rename key "FAR.NET" info "FarNet"

3) Install FarNet, see Readme.txt for instructions.

4) Install new FarNet plugins, e.g. PowerShellFar 2.x

5) If you have your own FarNet plugins rebuild them with new FarNet.

BREAKING CHANGES (MAJOR)

*) You have to change dependency from FarNetInt.dll to FarNet.dll and rename
namespace FarManager into FarNet.

*) Removed property Targeted from panels, use new property SelectedFiles.

*) Removed property IFile.IsSelected. Originally it was introduced "a la FAR
API", but in fact it is not fit well to FarNet concept and planned evolution.

*) IViewer, IEditor - boolean property EnableSwitch is replaced with Switching
with 3 states: Auto(default), Enabled and Disabled.

BREAKING CHANGES (MINOR)

A few renamings for better consistency, discoverability and English, too.

*) IPanel:
Current -> CurrentFile
Contents -> ShownFiles
Selected -> SelectedFiles

*) All names *PanelPlugin* renamed into *PluginPanel*, e.g. new names are:
IPluginPanel, IPluginPanelInfo, CreatePluginPanel() and etc.

*) IPluginPanel.Another -> AnotherPanel

*) MessageOptions -> MsgOptions (to conform with IFar.Msg())

*) KeyCode constants:
- all names now are the same as FAR macro key names
- Ctrl, Alt, Shift moved to another type: KeyMode

*) VKeyCode constants:
- Ctrl, Alt, Shift moved to another type: VKeyMode

OTHER CHANGES

*) Do not use new properties CodePage in IEditor and IViewer, they are added,
but it turned out that FAR does not use them yet :)

= 3.3.57 =

ANNOUNCEMENT

This version is presumably the last one for FAR 1.x; the next version is going
to be for Unicode FAR 2.x. If you find new or know some old issues in 3.3.57,
report as soon as possible, this is the last call, then support of the frozen
version will be very limited.

FIX/CHANGE

*) Two accidentally related issues: fixed regression in IFar.ShowHelp();
changed how IPanel.GoToName() works with empty names: now it ignores them
(well, empty names are technically possible, but it is a weird case anyway).

HOUSEKEEPING

*) Refactoring and cleaning of legacy code shared between IFar.Msg and recently
removed obsolete IMessage.

= 3.3.56 =

*) Improved control over panel opening and possible failures. Fixed cases when
opening used to fail silently, now errors with explained reasons are shown.

*) IPanel.GoToPath() - fixed a few issues with not complete paths.

*) As it was announced, obsolete method IFar.CreateMessage() and interface
IMessage are removed. Use one of 5 overloaded IFar.Msg() methods instead.

= 3.3.55 =

CHANGES

*) Logic of IKeyMacroHost.Install(IDictionary[]) is changed. This is not a
breaking change but if you use it you have to take a look at the manual.

FIXED

*) False error "Cannot open a plugin panel at this moment." in rare cases.
*) Minor issue in error message in editor on opening a file with null name.

OBSOLETE

*) As it was announced in 3.3.44, method IFar.CreateMessage() and interface
IMessage are obsolete and will be removed. Use IFar.Msg() instead, these 5
methods provide the same features and also some improvements.

= 3.3.54 =

*) New property IPluginPanel.DataComparison - compares data attached to panel
items (normally in order to restore the current item correctly). Needed for
cases with not trivial equality.

*) New property IPluginPanel.IdleUpdate - tells to update and redraw the panel
automatically when idle. Useful for frequently changed data.

*) New user property Guid IPanel.Id - normally assigned once and used by a
creator for distinguishing panel types and reusing opened panels.

*) New method IFar.GetPluginPanel(Guid) - gets opened plugin panel by ID (see
above). Can be used for reusing already opened panels.

= 3.3.53 =

This is mostly a technical build reflecting FAR API changes up to 1.75.2494.

There are though a couple of new items in FAR.NET:
*) IPanel.GoToName() - sets an item current by its name;
*) IPanel.GoToPath() - similar to FAR command goto:<path>.

= 3.3.52 =

*) New event IControl.Drawing (e.g. it can be used to draw a user control by
IFar.WriteText and IFar.WritePalette methods).
*) New enum PaletteColor - standard FAR color palette indexes.
*) New IFar.WritePalette - to write text using standard FAR colors.
*) New IFar.GetPaletteBackground, IFar.GetPaletteForeground get palette colors.
*) IAnyViewer, IViewer - new events GotFocus, LosingFocus (FAR 1.71.2406).

= 3.3.51 =

*) IEditor.Cursor is {get; set;} property now (it was {get;} only).

= 3.3.50 =

MACRO MANAGEMENT

- REMOVED obsolete IFar methods: LoadMacros(), SaveMacros(), PostMacro(). Use
new methods of IKeyMacroHost: Load(), Save(), Post().

DOCUMENTATION

- Improved look of member tables: set relative column width
- Removed annoying members inherited from System.Object
- Other little improvements and topic updates.

OTHER

- Added protected constructor to BasePlugin. It denies instances of this class.

= 3.3.49 =

MACRO MANAGEMENT

- New interface IKeyMacroHost exposed as IFar.KeyMacro property. It provides
methods for macro management.

- New class KeyMacroData: data set describing a macro. It is used by
IKeyMacroHost to get\set a macro data. Note: property names and values are
related to FAR native registry names and values, but this relation is not always
direct, RTFM.

- These IFar methods are OBSOLETE and will be removed: LoadMacros(),
SaveMacros(), PostMacro(). Use new methods of IKeyMacroHost: Load(), Save(),
Post(). Note: new Post() uses 'enableOutput' parameter which is 'false' by
default instead of PostMacro() 'disableOutput' which is 'true' by default.

DOCUMENTATION

- New style of .CHM documentation. Old MSDN style actually has more disadvantages
and it is difficult to improve. New style is somehow simpler and still can be
improved in next versions. What is already improved:
*) separated indexes of properties with same names;
*) overloaded methods are all shown in member list;
*) method parameter names are shown in contents;
*) enabled advanced search features;
*) added favourites tab.

OTHER CHANGES

- IListMenu: if filter is not enabled then filter dialog should not start.

= 3.3.48 =

- Fixed error messages in viewer on Add|Subtract keys ~ open next|prev file.

- IFar: new property ILine Line { get; }: current editor line in any area (it is
$Psf.HotLine moved from PowerShellFar).

- IFar: new method KeyToName(): converts an internal key code to its string
representation.

- ILine: new property WindowType: parent window type (Editor, Panels, Dialog).

- IListMenu: by default in any list menu keys [CtrlC] and [CtrlIns] are used to
copy text of the current item to the clipboard.

= 3.3.47 =

- IListBox: new method SetFrame() to set both current and top positions.

= 3.3.46 =

- Fixed IFar.AnyEditor.EditText(): error if the text is empty and the file is
not saved on exit.

= 3.3.44 =

- One more method IFar.Msg() with extra parameter 'helpTopic' (FYI: it looks
like IMessage is completely covered by IFar.Msg() methods and perhaps it will be
removed in the future).
- IListMenu.Incremental: '*' in the end in 'prefix' mode: see help for more
(example: used by completions in PowerShellFar).
- IEditor.Open(): if a file is already opened then start position, if any, is
not set -- fixed.

= 3.3.43 =

- Avoided inconvenient for plugin development internal exceptions on loading
when plugin assemblies are changed and registry cache has to updated.
- IMessage, IFar.Msg() - if a message contains too many buttons or their text is
too long, then a dialog with a list box is used instead of a message box where
list-box items work as buttons.
- New property IPanel.IsLeft (FAR 1.71.2348).
- REMOVED IMessage.Reset() because it is not actually needed or used.

= 3.3.42 =

MENU AND LIST DIALOG CONTROLS

- BREAKING. Interface IMenuItems was completely removed and standard collection
type was used instead. Not standard methods Add() of IMenuItems were moved to
IAnyMenu.Add(). In other words, in your code replace "menu.Items.Add(<text>)"
with "menu.Add(<text>)".
- New dynamic property IBaseList.Items (IListBox, IComboBox), see help. In
brief: when a dialog is started this collection is mapped to a FAR control
dynamically, i.e. all operations (set, insert, remove and etc.) are displayed
immediately. See also new DetachItems(), AttachItems().
- New method IFar::CreateMenuItem()

OTHER

- IControl.Rect is also settable (always); IDialog.Rect is settable before
Show(); after Show() you can use new methods Move() and Resize().

= 3.3.41 =

- This is mostly a technical build for FAR 1.71.2346
- New IListBox.Title. IListBox.Text get\set is mapped to the current item text
(dynamically, i.e. when a dialog is opened).

= 3.3.40 =

- Access to dialogs and controls. New property IFar.Dialog - the current dialog
if any (including standard FAR dialogs). You can get the current dialog item as
IDialog.Focused or by index and work on it, e.g. get or set text of the current
IEdit. Some controls in not FAR.NET dialogs are not fully supported yet.
Example: Complete-Word-.ps1 from PowerShellFar completes a word from history of
any edit control in any FAR dialog. See also Generate-Dialog-.ps1 as a demo of
access to all dialog controls and properties.

- New IFar.GetDialogHistory() - gets saved dialog history by its name (used by
Complete-Word-.ps1 for completion from editor control history).

- BREAKING: removed IText.Separator2 and converted type of IText.Separator from
bool to int: 0: standard text; 1: single line separator; 2: double line
separator.

- New helper IAnyViewer.ViewText - opens a viewer to view some text. Similar to
IAnyEditor.EditText but you can also choose whether it is modal or not.

- Slightly changed action on setting of IPanel.Path and IPanelPath.Path: if the
panel is a plugin not supporting the path then it is closed and a FAR panel is
opened if the new path exists.

= 3.3.39 =

CHANGED
- VKeyCode names was made compatible with System.ConsoleKey names.

OBSOLETE
- Removed obsolete editor and viewer properties DeleteOnClose and
DeleteOnlyFileOnClose. Use new property DeleteSource (enum DeleteSource).
- Removed obsolete editor events AfterOpen, AfterClose, BeforeSave. Use new
events: Opened, Closed, Saving. Updated demo plugin Plugins.NET \ TrimSaving.

= 3.3.38 =

NEW
- Many new features in IViewer and new interface IAnyViewer. In short, viewer
management is now similar to editor management (but features are different).
- Minor changes in IEditor and replacements for obsoletes (see below).
- IFar: TempName(), TempFolder().

FIX
- Improved error detection on Open() in editor and viewer (it used to throw a
false error in some rare special cases).

OBSOLETE\CHANGED
- Removed editor and viewer properties Async and IsModal. Use new method Open(
OpenMode ). Old method Open() with no parameter works as Open( OpenMode.None ).
- Editor and viewer properties DeleteOnClose and DeleteOnlyFileOnClose will be
removed, use new property and enum DeleteSource.
- Editor events AfterOpen, AfterClose, BeforeSave will be removed because their
names violate .NET naming guidelines; use new events: Opened, Closed, Saving.

= 3.3.37 =

Recommended FAR 1.71.2315

NEW
- IFar.Redraw() for FAR 1.71.2315
- IMenuItem.Disabled works in menus.
- IMenuItem.Text + IsSeparator is shown in menus.
- IMenuItem.From enables\disables a menu item "automatically".
- IMenu: item properties (except Text) can be changed in locked mode.
- BasePlugin.Invoking(): rarely needed, but sometimes useful, see help.
- IUserControl - currently it is not really a user defined control with custom
drawing, but it still can be used to receive some events where other controls
are not suitable.

OBSOLETE
- REMOVED property BreakCode from menus, see 3.3.36 notes.
- Editor and viewer properties Async and IsModal WILL BE REMOVED. Use new method
Open( OpenMode ) with OpenMode enum. Old method Open() with no parameter is also
obsolete for now, don't use it for this transition period; but it will not be
removed, later it will work as Open( OpenMode.None ).

Requires FAR 1.71 alpha 4 (build 2309)
http://forum.farmanager.com/viewtopic.php?p=29848#29848

NEW IN FAR.NET
- EditorPlugin - yet another plugin helper, see help and examples.

NEW IN FAR API AND FAR.NET
- Support of FAR plugins menu in dialogs.
- IEdit.NoAutoComplete ~ DIF_NOAUTOCOMPLETE.
- Events GotFocus and LosingFocus in plugin panels and editor instances.
- Enum FarMacroState, property IFar.MacroState ~ FARMACROSTATE, MCMD_GETSTATE.

FIXED
- Memory was not freed on PasteFromClipboard().

CHANGED
- Moved property WordDiv from IFar to IAnyEditor.
- Converted property IFar.Editors into method Editors(), it returns an array of
opened editors.

OBSOLETE
- Property BreakCode in menus (IListMenu and IMenu) will be removed, use the new
property BreakKey instead. For IListMenu it is simply renaming; for IMenu it is
not an index of a break key but a key code itself - this way looks more natural
and makes coding and changes easier.

= 3.3.35 =

NEW

- CommandPlugin, FilerPlugin classes - two more plugin helpers, see .CHM help
and Plugins.NET examples.
- ToolPlugin, CommandPlugin, FilerPlugin are normally not preloaded, i.e.
information is read from the registry cache only and an assembly is loaded only
when a plugin feature is invoked.
- FAR.NET config allows to edit file masks of file plugins.
- FAR.NET features are described in .hlf topics (also opened on F1).
- Loading plugins: if a DLL has nothing to load an exception is thrown. This DLL
has to be removed from a plugin folder or a .cfg file has to be used to define
what DLLs and classes are loaded exactly.
- New information in Readme.txt.

FIXED

- Recent bug: can't not open a panel when two panels are already opened.
- Command prefixes were case sensitive.
- IEdit.Line.Insert() did not work.
- A few x64 issues.

CHANGED
- Removed obsolete IFar.Clipboard, use CopyToClipboard and PasteFromClipboard.
- A few breaking renamings in the recent features for the sake of common names
style: RegisterPrefix -> RegisterCommand (actually we register a command, prefix
is only a default suggestion); UnregisterPrefix -> UnregisterCommand;
ExecutingEventArgs -> CommandEventArgs (for plugin); RegisterFile ->
RegisterFiler; UnregisterFile -> UnregisterFiler; OpenFileEventArgs ->
FilerEventArgs.
- RegisterFiler has two more parameters: 'mask' and 'creates'.
- FilerEventArgs.Data type changed from byte[] to System.IO.Stream (to avoid
redundant data copy), see example in Plugins.NET.

= 3.3.34 =

MAIN CHANGES (BREAKING) AND NEW FEATURES
(result of all recent forum discussions)

- IFar.Register*|Unregister* methods are quite different, see .CHM and updated
examples. BasePlugin class can be used as usual with new Register*|Unregister*
methods. There is also a new simpler helper ToolPlugin - all you need is to
implement a single method (other stuff is up to you).
- FAR.NET provides some configuration tools for all its plugins: 1) you can edit
plugin menu strings in different areas (Panels, Editor, Viewer..); 2) you can
edit all prefixes according to your preferences or to resolve conflicts; plugins
may do not care of prefixes in their configurations.
- Removed IFar.From as not really important. Plugin handlers have this info.
Besides, new IFar.GetWindowType() gets almost the same information.
- Slightly changed rules of loading plugins, see Readme.txt.

HOTKEYS

- You have to reset your hotkeys. It is recommended to set the main FAR.NET
hotkey as usual by F4 and set other FAR.NET hotkeys by ampersands in Options \
Plugins configuration \ .NET \ Panels tools, Editor tools, Viewer tools (yes,
.NET plugins may have different hotkeys in different areas).

NEW

- Button [Copy Info] in error dialog copies the error info to the clipboard.
- IFar.PostStep() returns control to FAR and after that invokes a step handler.

FIXED

- "Index out of range" in IListMenu when a key handler changes menu items.

CHANGED

- IFar.Msg(string) and IFar.Msg(string, string) return void. Other Msg methods
as usual return pressed button index or -1 on Escape.
- VKeyCode: some keys were renamed according to .NET naming guidelines.

OBSOLETE

- Property IFar.Clipboard will be removed, use methods CopyToClipboard and
PasteFromClipboard. Property is sometimes triggered when it is not really
wanted: e.g. in debugger, in PowerShell member list and etc.

= 3.3.33 =

NEW

- You can now open as many panels as you want (or keep one invisible for later
use). Of course, only two of them can be shown but the others can be pushed to
the stack by IPluginPanel.Push so that later you can IPluginPanel.Open them.
Another new related methods: IFar.ShowPanelMenu() - panel menu where you can
push a panel or open pushed panels (it is included in plugins and disk menus);
IFar.PushedPanels() - array of pushed panels, IPluginPanel.Post*() - used
internally to remember and restore the current file in a pushed panel.
- IPluginPanel.DotsDescription (used together with AddDots).
- IPluginPanelInfo.InfoItems allows to set custom info panel items.
- IPluginPanelInfo.SetKeyBar*() allows to set custom key bar labels.
- IFar.{Register|Unregister}OpenFile() implements OpenFilePlugin FAR API.
- VKeyCode - some of virtual key codes.

BREAKING CHANGES

- Property AddDots moved from IPluginPanelInfo to IPluginPanel, i.e. item dots
now is rather panel data than info.
- StringDelegate was removed, RegisterPrefix uses now another type of handler:
EventHandler<ExecutingEventArgs>. This way is more flexible for future changes
and allows to RegisterPrefix from PowerShell.
- Removed obsolete IFar.AnotherPanel; use IFar.Panel2 instead.
- Renamed OpenPluginMenuItemEventArgs into PluginMenuEventArgs.

FIXED/IMPROVED

- Fixed IPluginPanel.PuttingFiles Event.
- Fixed (or, say, implemented) processing of AddDots in panels.
- Avoided redundant internal memory allocations on GetPluginInfo().
- IFar.Plugin bug when two plugin panels are opened and one of them is under
the info panel.
- Restored removed by mistake IFar.Unregister* methods.

= 3.3.32 =

FIXED/IMPROVED

- Fixed memory leaks on panel operations.
- Optimized memory use on panel operations.
- Avoided redundant panel updates in some cases.

NEW

- IAnyEditor.EditText() - simple way to edit text in a modal editor.
- IFar.PostMacro()

OBSOLETE/CHANGED/REMOVED

- IFar.AnotherPanel will be removed, use IFar.Panel2 instead.
- Methods IFar.CreateKeySequence() and IFar.PostKeySequence() work with int[],
not IList<int>.
- Removed IPluginMenuItem and CreatePluginsMenuItem, RegisterPlugins*Item. Use
methods RegisterPlugins*Item(string, handler) instead.

= 3.3.31 =

NEW

- IFar.LoadMacros(), IFar.SaveMacros().

REVISION: IMenu, IListMenu

- IMenu does not support filters any more, it is now pure MENU OF COMMANDS, as
simple and effective as possible. If your menu is rather a LIST OF OBJECTS for
selection than use IListMenu, which provides filters: permanent and incremental,
both with variety of PatternOptions.

- Migration from IMenu to IListMenu (if you really need it) is simple: semantics
is the same, just rename IMenu and CreateMenu to IListMenu and CreateListMenu;
actually only keys are different: IMenu uses virtual key codes, IListMenu uses
internal key codes added by AddKey() with optional handlers.

- If you use permanent filter than, to enable it, now you have to define
IListMenu.FilterOption according to your preferences, not FilterKey, which is
now set to default (CtrlDown) and you don't have to fuss about internal codes,
at least for this.

- [F1] in list menus and input filter dialogs opens basic FAR.NET help about
predefined and recommended list menu keys and about patterns used for filters.

= 3.3.30 =

NEW

- IAnyMenu - any menu interface; IMenu is now derived from it.
- IListMenu, Far.CreateListMenu() - new style menu with extra features, e.g.
incremental filter on typing (substring/prefix/wildcard). It is ready to use,
but further changes are very possible.
- Far.CodeToChar() - converts internal key code to char (20h-FFh).
- KeyCode - helper constants for internal key codes (subject to change).

REMOVED
(these changes are unlikely breaking, but...)

- Removed IListItem, use IMenuItem instead (items of combo and list boxes).
In other words property Items of IMenu, IListMenu, IComboBox, IListBox is a
collection of IMenuItem's. If you used IListItem directly, just rename it.
- Removed IMenu.OnClick - it turned out that it was declared but not really
implemented or used. Looks like it was declared by mistake.

= 3.3.28 =

- Added property IMenu.Sender:object; this object is passed in event handler as
a sender. By default IMenuItem is a sender.

= 3.3.26 =

PLUGIN PANELS
- New property IPluginPanel.StartDirectory (current directory when it starts).

REMOVED
- Removed IFar.UnregisterPluginsDiskItem, IFar.UnregisterPluginsMenuItem, see
explanation in history 3.3.25.

= 3.3.25 =

OBSOLETE
- IFar.UnregisterPluginsDiskItem, IFar.UnregisterPluginsMenuItem are obsolete
and will be removed because they are not really effective: registration is done
only when Connect() is called and it cannot be 'undone'. Besides, when FAR.NET
is disconnected all registered items are 'unregistered' automatically. Example
plugin sources are already updated, you may have to update your existing
plugins too: simply remove calls of these methods. Bonus: you don't have to keep
menu item references waiting for Disconnect() to be unregistered, and in most
cases a plugin does not have to implement Disconnect() at all.

PLUGIN CONFIGURATION
- New method RegisterPluginsConfigItem(): adds "Plugin configuration" item.

WINDOWS
- New property IFar.WindowCount {get}.
- New interface IWindowInfo and enum WindowType.
- New methods IFar: GetWindowInfo(), SetCurrentWindow(), Commit().

DIALOGS
New features mostly simplifying creation of a dialog and especially future
modifications of it (Test-Dialog-.ps1 in PowerShellFar shows them all):
- IDialog.AddBox(): if a parameter right\bottom is 0 then it is calculated;
- New properties IDialog.Rect, IControl.Rect (useful for relative positions);
- New property IDialog.NoSmartCoords. By default coordinates are "smart", i.e.
not positive Top is subtracted from the previous control Top: (0) - the same
line, (-1) - the next line, and so on. See more in help.
- New property IDialog.Cancel:IButton - if it is set and the button is pushed
then Selected is set to this button as usually, but Show() returns false now.

PLUGIN PANELS
- REMOVED property IPluginPanelInfo.ConfirmClose because of FE_CLOSE issues: it
may not happen or it may happen when a panel is not about to close.
- New methods IPanel.Close() and IPanel.Close(string path).
- REMOVED method IFar.ClosePanel(), instead of it use IPanel.Close() (also for
IPluginPanel), i.e. call Far.Panel.Close() to close an active panel,
Far.Panel2.Close() to close a passive panel, <IPluginPanel>.Close() to close a
plugin panel (active or passive).

= 3.3.23 =

- New methods IFar.{Get|Set}PluginValue(string pluginName, string valueName,
object {default|new}Value) to {get|set} a plugin value stored in the registry,
usually at "Software\Far\Plugins" (or "Software\Far\Users\user1\Plugins" if FAR
is started started with '/u user1' parameter). "pluginName" defines a subkey
there; the subkey is created if it does not exist even if you only get a value.

= 3.3.22 =

- Fixed most (all?) of x64 issues. Sources are ready for x64. Currently binaries
are provided for x32 only, sorry for inconvenience.

= 3.3.19 =

- Added 'set' method to property IPanel.NumericSort.
- Fixed issues in plugin panel start sort modes.

= 3.3.18 =

- Properties IPanel.{ReverseSortOrder | SortMode | ViewMode} are now 'get\set'
(i.e. not 'get' only).
- New properties IFar.{RootFar | RootKey} - registry paths taking into account
a user, e.g. '/u user1' in FAR command line.
- Improved switching\keeping\restoring of plugin panels modes.
- Fixed lib path in Build-JS.bat.
- Fixed ReplaceSlashes.js in examples.

= 3.3.17 =

- removed obsolete properties {ILines | IStrings}.Text; please, use methods
{IEditor | ISelection}.{GetText | SetText}.

= 3.3.16 =

- new property IFar.From:OpenFrom - where a plugin is opened from.
- new property IPanel.Window:Place - panel coordinates.
- new properties IEditor.TrueLines,TrueSelection: no empty last line if any.
They are designed for convenient reading or changing existing lines in foreach
loops; Add(), Insert(), RemoveAt() are available, but not yet recommended, they
can not be used in foreach anyway.

OBSOLETE:
- properties {ILines | IStrings}.Text will be removed; please, use methods
{IEditor | ISelection}.{GetText | SetText} - they will be more effective.
ILines and IStrings will be almost nothing but ILine and string lists.

= 3.3.15 =

- Far.exe.config: added option FarManager.StartupErrorDialog: 0: write error
info to console (default); 1: show standard error dialog (you may want to turn
it on to view error info in viewer (button [Info])).
- fixed exception on clipboard failure.
- fixed broken examples in Plugins.NET folder

= 3.3.14 =

BREAKING CHANGE: some of IFile properties and panel modes enums renamed using
names of standard .NET class FileSystemInfo. Sorry for that, but it should be
much more convenient than to have 3 different set of names for the same things.

Panels:
- change: IFar.CreatePluginPanel() creates a panel, then IPluginPanel.Open()
should be called explicitly.
- removed IPluginPanel.Panel:IPanel. Instead, IPluginPanel is derived from
IPanel and implements some functionality more effectively.
- removed IPanel.Top (it looks like it is not used), use IPanel.TopIndex which
is really needed.
- IFar.Panel, IFar.Panel2: if it is a FAR.NET plugin panel it returns
IPluginPanel (derived from IPanel, see above).
- IFile.Tag:int was replaced with IFile.Data:object, so that you can attach any
objects to your plugin panel items.

= 3.3.13 =

Plugin panels:
- new method IFar.GetPluginPanel().
- removed from public interface property IPluginPanel.Id (used internally).
- new IPluginPanel.Another - another FAR.NET IPluginPanel if it exists.
- new IPluginPanel.Panel - IPanel interface for this IPluginPanel.
- new IPluginPanel.Host - you may use it if you have more than one panel.

Plugin disk menu:
- Added IFar.{Register | Unregister} PluginsDiskItem(): the same as
IFar.{Register | Unregister} PluginsMenuItem() but for FAR disk menu.

= 3.3.12 =

- Updated Plugins.NET\IronPython plugin (by Max Belugin).
- IFar.Input(): added 3 overloaded methods and changed parameter order in
the existing method: prompt, history, title, text.

= 3.3.11 =

- Fixed minor issues on exceptions in plugin panel events.
- IFar: new method Input() - helper to create and show IInputBox.
- IEditor: fixed exceptions from get-properties of not opened editor.
- Added Plugins.NET\Ipy: plugin to run scripts in IronPython (by Max Belugin).

= 3.3.10 =

- IFar: new method ClosePanel(): closes the current plugin panel.
- IPluginPanelInfo: new property ConfirmClose:bool.
- IPanel: new method Redraw(int, int).
- IFile: new property: Tag:int. It works as user data attached to an item.
Unfortunately Data:object, as in other interfaces, is not possible for IFile.
Removed properties Path and ParentPath, sorry for a breaking change, but they
were error prone in many cases (and redundant in many other cases); thus, if you
need parent path take it as IPanel.Path and then you decide what Path is in your
scenario: with slash, backslash, nothing, ... (if you need Path at all).
- Refactoring of panel related interfaces for new plugin panel functionality,
added new features, some minor changes may be breaking.
- Updated documentation.

= 3.3.9 =

- Implemented plugin panel interfaces: main of them are: IPluginPanel and
IPluginPanelInfo. See docs for details. Not yet everything is implemented but
significant part. Everything is a subject to change, this is the first version.
A simple but not really trivial example is Search-Regex-.ps1 in PowerShellFar.
- Refactoring for panel plugins: removed interface IFolder; replaced property
IFolder IFile.Parent with string IFile.ParentPath; replaced property IFolder
IPanel.Contents with IList<IFile> IPanel.Contents.
- Removed from public interface currently redundant IPluginMenuItem.FireOnOpen()
and IMenuItem.FireOnClick().

= 3.3.8 =

- Improved some XML doc code comments, updated CHM help. CHM help: removed MSDN
references, inherited .NET comments and other redundant information.
- Preliminary internal changes for coming features.

= 3.3.7 =

- Created CHM help: from now on the latest version can be downloaded from:
http://code.google.com/p/farnet/downloads/list
- IFar: two new methods Write() appending plain or colored text to the user
screen (under panels).
- FAR.NET does not show now error message boxes during the procedure of loading
plugins (it is annoying if problems are known and temporary). Instead, it writes
all error messages to the user screen and continues.

= 3.3.6 =

- Removed: IMenuItem.Selected and related IMenu.Show(int) and parameters
Selected from several methods IMenuItems.Add(). Instead, IMenu.Show() uses
IMenu.Selected as input if it is set. This way seems more consistent than
approach with IMenuItem.Selected (potential conflict between items).

= 3.3.5 =

- ILine.Pos: setting of a negative value moves cursor to the end of a line.
- New ILine.Length: text length; use it when text itself is irrelevant.
- New IEditor.GoEnd(): effective way to move cursor to the end of file.
- IFar.Msg(): header: chars '\t', '\r', '\n', if any, are replaced with spaces.
- Removed FarPluginsLoader.dll; you have to do it manually (in %FARHOME%\Lib).
- Fixed recent bugs in menus.
- New property IMenu.SelectLast: tells to select the last item.
- New IMenu feature: filters. See XML docs for properties Filter, FilterKey,
FilterHistory, FilterRestore.

= 3.3.4 =

- Implemented IEdit\IComboBox.Line.Selection.
- Interfaces IRect, IStream, ITwoPoints are replaced with value type with
neutral name Place which can be used as Rect, Stream or TwoPoints.
- New properties HelpTopic in IDialog, IMenu, IInputBox, IMessage and new method
IFar.ShowHelp().
- Removed FarDotNetStruct.dll; you should remove it manually if you have one,
normally it is in here: "%FARHOME%\Lib\".

= 3.3.3 =

- New editor methods Begin()\End(). They drastically improve performance of
operations on large number of editor lines. Example: an operation used to take
2-3 minutes on a file containing 40,000 lines; now being used with Begin\End it
takes 4 seconds.
- Interface ICursor is replaced with struct TextFrame + related properties
Frame, Cursor and methods GoTo*.
- New property Line (ILine) in IEdit and IComboBox.
- Fixed crash in dialogs on Idled event.

= 3.3.2 =

- Fixed IInputBox.History issue.
- IEditor: new ConvertPosToTab(), ConvertTabToPos() and ConvertScreenToCursor()
- IMenu.Show() automatically changes coordinate Y (if >= 0) if items are out of
the screen.
- Interface IPoint is replaced with struct Point.

= 3.3.1 =

- New dialog item IComboBox, IListBox, password editor and vertical text or
separator.
- Implemented main dialog events. See Test-Dialog-.ps1 in PowerShellFar 1.1.1
for examples.
- Most of dialog items properties are dynamic, i.e. when a dialog is started
they reflect the current dialog state both for reading and writing. Example:
Test-Dialog-.ps1 - button [Test] and related code.
- IFar.Msg(): supported line delimiters are \r, \n  \r\n, Tabs are replaced
with spaces. Text is wrapped if required. Two new methods IFar.Msg() with more
options.
- Revision of old Key, Mouse and related events. New structs are KeyInfo and
MouseInfo.

= 3.3.0 =

- FarManager.Forms: implemented IDialog, IBox (double, single), IButton,
ICheckBox, IEdit (standard, fixed), IRadioButton, IText. Example -
Test-Dialog-.ps1 in PowerShellFar 1.1.0.
- New method IFar.CreateViewer() and interface IViewer.
- New method IFar.WriteText().
- Revision of IInputBox.
- IFar.PostText() processes \n, \r and \r\n as Enter. Empty text and empty key
sequence for IFar.PostKeys() is not an error.
- Optimized some string operations.

= 3.2.9 =

- Improved exception handling.
- New IFar.ShowError() for internal use but can be used externally as well.
- New IFar.PostText().

= 3.2.8 =

- New IFar.GetHistory()
- IVersion is replaced with System.Version

= 3.2.7 =

- New IEditor.CurrentLine of type ILine.
- New in ILine: Pos, Insert(), Select(), Unselect().
- IFar.CommandLine is ILine now. ICommandLine is removed.
- IFar.GetUserScreen() sends "user screen" to screen. Far >= 1.71.2187.
- IPanel.IsVisible is get\set (set works via sending CtrlF1\F2).

= 3.2.6 =

- New IMenuItem.Data, IMenu.SelectedData, IPanel.NumericSort,
IFar.SetUserScreen(), ICommandLine.Insert().
- IEditor.ExpandTabs type is enum ExpandTabsMode.
- Improved some exceptions info.

= 3.2.5 =

- Minor changes in IMenu  ISelection and fix of potential crash of a menu with
incorrect coordinates.

= 3.2.4 =

- Main editor functionality is now implemented as it was designed.
- Vast revision of existing IEditor implementation.
- New IEditor.Bookmarks().
- New properties in IPanel, mostly 'get', but Path is also 'set'.
- New interface ICommandLine and property IFar.CommandLine.
- Examples: added Build-CS.bat, Build-JS.bat, Build-VB.bat.

= 3.2.3 =

- Implemented lists in editor.
- All collections are generic now.
- All event handlers are standard now (i.e.: object sender, ..EventArgs e).

= 3.2.1 =

- Fixed selection in editor.
- Completed .NET 2.0 porting.

= 3.1.? and older =

- 29.08.06 - ported to .NET 2.0
- 19.08.05 - beta stage
- editor fixes
- new plugin loading scheme
- new IFar.RegisterPluginsMenuItem(name, onclick)
- new IMenuItems.Add(name, onclick)
- XML comments in FarNetIntf.dll
- 11.08.05 - alpha stage
- new settings in Far.exe.config
- further editor implementation
- added demo plugins: CopyShared, JS.NetCalc, ReplaceSlashes
- 19.07.05 - started implementation of editor, fixed bugs in panels
- 16.05.05 - implemented SHPCE 2.0 functionality (except editor)
