SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Installs, updates, and uninstalls NuGet packages for Far Manager.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    This module contains tools for NuGet packages with special structure for
    Far Manager. Packages are FarNet and FarNet modules, in the first place.
    But the tools work with any such package, e.g. it can be a plugin, too.

    The key feature is ability to automatically update files, i.e. to check for
    a newer version, remove installed files, get and unpack the new files. This
    is done with Update.<PackageID>.info files in the Far Manager directory.

    The module exports these functions:

        Install-FarPackage
        Restore-FarPackage
        Update-FarPackage
        Uninstall-FarPackage

     Use Get-Help in order to get all the details.

     Some typical tasks are described below with recommended steps. Other ways
     are possible, too, but they may require commands with more parameters.

HOW TO INSTALL A PACKAGE

    In Far Manager panels navigate to its home directory, e.g. invoke

        cd %FARHOME%

    Start a new PowerShell console from there:

        start PowerShell

    WARNING: Close Far Manager if a package was installed before.

    In PowerShell v3.0+ skip this, in PowerShell v2.0 invoke:

        PS> Import-Module FarPackage

    Then use Install-FarPackage, for example:

        PS> Install-FarPackage FarNet
        PS> Install-FarPackage FarNet.PowerShellFar

HOW TO UPDATE PACKAGES

    The steps are the same as above with two differences:
    - Always close Far Manager after staring PowerShell.
    - Use the command Update-FarPackage:

        PS> Update-FarPackage

    Note that this command checks all installed packages for newer versions and
    updates them when needed. If a particular package should be updated alone
    then use the command Install-FarPackage, it supports updates as well.

OTHER FUNCTIONS

    Function Restore-FarPackage is similar to Install-FarPackage. It installs
    directly from a package file. It can be used where internet is missing.

    Example:

        PS> Restore-FarPackage FarNet.Vessel.2.0.5.nupkg

    Function Uninstall-FarPackage removes the specified package files and empty
    remaining folders. Extra files added by a user are not removed.

    Example:

        PS> Uninstall-FarPackage FarNet.Vessel
