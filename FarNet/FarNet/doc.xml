  <EditorList>
    <para>
      This list is only for iterations, access by indexes, and removal by
      indexes. Accessed lines allow changes but new strings should not
      contain line separators. Other editor changes during using this
      list may cause unexpected results and should be avoided.

  <RegisterModule>
    <para>
      If you plan to unregister this action then keep the returned reference and call its <see cref="IModuleAction.Unregister"/> later.
      Instead of keeping the reference you can get it by its ID by the <see cref="IFar"/>.<c>GetModule*()</c> methods.
    </para>
  </RegisterModule>
  <ActionGuid>
    <para>
      Use <c>System.Runtime.InteropServices.GuidAttribute</c> for the action ID.

    </summary>
    <remarks>
      In the wrap cursor mode moving the cursor up from the first element or down from the last element

    <summary>
      Called on the button clicks and similar actions: [Enter] when focused or the hotkey at any time.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      NOTE: even if this is the default control (<see cref="IDialog.Default"/>) or
      the cancel button (<see cref="IDialog.Cancel"/>) the event is not triggered
      if the button is not explicitly clicked or a similar action is performed.
      Thus, [CtrlEnter] (accept the dialog) and [Esc] (cancel the dialog)
      do not trigger this event.
    </remarks>
  </ButtonClicked>
  <ShowAmpersand>
    <summary>

    <summary>
      File(s) mask, see Far API help topic [File masks]; format "include|exclude" is also supported.
      This value is only the default suggestion, actual mask may be changed by a user.
    </summary>
  </FileMask>
  <BaseListItems>
    <summary>
      List item collection. STOP: see remarks.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      Normally you fill the list with items and set their properties before opening a
      dialog. After opening this collection is mapped to a control dynamically, i.e.
      all operations (set, insert, remove and etc.) are displayed immediately. The
      items themselves are not mapped dynamically, so that if you change an item then
      you have to reset it explicitly, see the example.
      <para>
        Dynamic mapping is simple, useful and effective when you change (or add, remove)
        one item at a time (or just a few items). But if you actually recreate all the
        items then for better performance you have to use <see cref="DetachItems"/>
        before changes and <see cref="AttachItems"/> after changes.
      </para>
    </remarks>
    <example>
      (PowerShell): how to set an item checked when the dialog is running
      <code>
        <![CDATA[
# get an item
$item = $listbox.Items[3]
# change it
$item.Checked = $true
# set it!
$listbox.Items[3] = $item
]]>
