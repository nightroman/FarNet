= 2.0.4 =

The package moved to NuGet.

Changes in documentation.

= 2.0.3 =

Adapted for FarNet 5.0.31

= 2.0.2 =

Use FarNet 5.0.5. Initial generation of the log from Far history is back.

= 2.0.1 =

Automatic log update and training is also done once a day on the first use.
Thus, manual updates and trainings are not normally needed at all.

= 2.0.0 =

Adapted for Far3 + FarNet5.

= 1.0.11 =

Updated for FarNet 4.4.15

The local Vessel\Settings.resources (with training results) is now updated
separately from the roaming settings. Thus, if you use default settings then
the roaming file Vessel\Settings.resources can be removed.

= 1.0.10 =

The settings panel is opened from the .NET \ Settings menu.

The history log moved from %USERPROFILE%\VesselHistory.log to
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Far Manager\FarNet\Vessel\VesselHistory.log
(do this manually)

= 1.0.9 =

Updated for FarNet 4.4.0

Minor tweaks in ranking.

Fixed an error message in the list on ShiftDel + Esc.

= 1.0.8 =

Improved predictability of the model by taking into account evidences of
openings for idle periods. The test set shows 30-40% more gain for long enough
histories.

= 1.0.7 =

Use FarNet 4.3.35: key counts reflect actual changes better. This is quite
important statistics for Vessel.

Update removes from the history records of missing files, oldest files
exceeding the limit, and old records keeping at least one per file.

Added the registry options MaximumDayCount and MaximumFileCount.

Minor improvements of UI and training performance.

= 1.0.6 =

Training is now done in the background. When training has completed the menu
shows the "Training results" item until it is not visited once. This item is
also shown after automatic fast training.

Automatic fast training starts after updating the history file from the menu
and after opening not recent files from the smart history. It works in the
background and it is very fast (~50 times faster than full training).

Training result numbers do not include openings below Limit0: they are not
really important because they are the same as in the classic plain history.

= 1.0.5 =

Fix: plain history should be used on negative training results.

= 1.0.4 =

Fixed the plain history list and minor defects in 1.0.3.

= 1.0.3 =

* Use of closing time instead of opening time is better for a few reasons.
* Smart history list shows separators of the groups defined by factors.
* Training shows the progress form.
* Option Limits (see About-Vessel).
* Ranking model is based on two factors instead of one. As a result:
- Training is slow but factors can live longer without re-training.
- Expected about 10% more total gain.

= 1.0.2 =

* Training is 2-4 times faster.
* Fixed recent time is 2 hours.
* Expected extra gain is about 15%.

= 1.0.1 =

* Key counts are used in ranking.
* Improved ranking model and training.
* Expected extra gain is more than 20%.
