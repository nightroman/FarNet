https://www.nuget.org/packages/FarNet.Vessel
FarNet 5.4.17

= 3.0.0 =

New history concept, more on tracked items and far history than on AI.
Not necessarily better (may be) but comparable and more practical.

Log format is the same but on the first update logs will be reduced.
New Vessel does not have to keep so many tracking records as before.

[Del] in history lists stops or starts the current item tracking.

Settings `ChoiceLog` specifies the optional log file of choices.

= 2.7.1 =

Avoid unnecessary copies and orderings.
Use sliding span and age evidence ranking.

= 2.7.0 =

Simplified menu. Note the hotkey of "Smart commands" is 3.

Slightly improved predictions and performance.

= 2.6.2 =

Use net472, like FarNet.

Folder history:
- [ShiftEnter] opens the selected folder in a new window

= 2.6.1 =

Tweaks in help and settings.

= 2.6.0 =

Requires FarNet 5.6.0.
Uses new XML settings.
Remove old:
- %FARPROFILE%\FarNet\Vessel\Settings.resources
- %FARLOCALPROFILE%\FarNet\Vessel\Settings.local.resources

= 2.5.7 =

Maintenance.

= 2.5.6 =

Amend ShiftDel in file history for locked entries.

= 2.5.5 =

ShiftDel in lists also removes from Far history.

= 2.5.4 =

Fix command history regression.

= 2.5.3 =

Use FarNet 5.4.17
Assign 3 different guid to file, folder, command history dialogs.

= 2.5.2 =

Use FarNet 5.4.15
New setting MaximumFileCountFromFar limits items from Far history.

= 2.5.1 =

Minor tweaks.

= 2.5.0 =

Required .NET Framework 4.5

= 2.4.1 =

Command history items are case sensitive.

= 2.4.0 =

Support smart command history in addition to file and folder history.

New setting MaximumFileAge (~ 365 days) for removing old items.

Tweak heuristics for slightly better predictions.

= 2.3.3 =

Retired obsolete bits of code and settings.
Updated README and wiki: https://github.com/nightroman/FarNet/wiki/Vessel

= 2.3.2 =

Log known Far records on first openings from lists.
This improves predictions for newly opened items.

= 2.3.1 =

- Add file history records on "go to" from the history list.
- Do not add almost the same time entries from Far histories.

= 2.3.0 =

File history works in the same way as folder history, more effective.
Only openings from lists are logged and then joined with Far history.
Also, Vessel is not pre-loaded when Far starts.

= 2.2.1 =

Most recent folders from Far history were not properly positioned.

= 2.2.0 =

Smart folder history in addition to file history. It works in a different way
but the ideas and algorithm are the same. Folder history is a mix of the Far
folder history and Vessel opening events from the smart folder list.

Remove plain history list, there is no point in it in this module.
Rework training and updates.

Stop writing obsolete Keys to the log. The log is converted to new format on
[CtrlR] in history or on the first manual or automatic periodic update.

= 2.1.2 =

Fix getting the log file path.

= 2.1.1 =

Ignore invalid records in the history file.

= 2.1.0 =

Revise AI and calculate ranks without background training.
Retire KeyCount as not so important factor.

= 2.0.6 =

History log is UTF8 instead of Unicode (git friendly, smaller, etc.).

Save your old history file with the new name and code page:

- goto: "%FARLOCALPROFILE%\FarNet\Vessel\VesselHistory.log"
- Edit (F4), save as "VesselHistory.txt", code page 65001 (ShiftF2)
- Click "Yes" to override the existing created from the Far history
- If all is fine then remove old "VesselHistory.log"

= 2.0.5 =

Amended package information.

= 2.0.4 =

The package moved to NuGet.

Changes in documentation.

= 2.0.3 =

Adapted for FarNet 5.0.31

= 2.0.2 =

Use FarNet 5.0.5. Initial generation of the log from Far history is back.

= 2.0.1 =

Automatic log update and training is also done once a day on the first use.
Thus, manual updates and trainings are not normally needed at all.

= 2.0.0 =

Adapted for Far3 + FarNet5.

= 1.0.11 =

Updated for FarNet 4.4.15

The local Vessel\Settings.resources (with training results) is now updated
separately from the roaming settings. Thus, if you use default settings then
the roaming file Vessel\Settings.resources can be removed.

= 1.0.10 =

The settings panel is opened from the .NET \ Settings menu.

The history log moved from %USERPROFILE%\VesselHistory.log to
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Far Manager\FarNet\Vessel\VesselHistory.log
(do this manually)

= 1.0.9 =

Updated for FarNet 4.4.0

Minor tweaks in ranking.

Fixed an error message in the list on ShiftDel + Esc.

= 1.0.8 =

Improved predictability of the model by taking into account evidences of
openings for idle periods. The test set shows 30-40% more gain for long enough
histories.

= 1.0.7 =

Use FarNet 4.3.35: key counts reflect actual changes better. This is quite
important statistics for Vessel.

Update removes from the history records of missing files, oldest files
exceeding the limit, and old records keeping at least one per file.

Added the registry options MaximumDayCount and MaximumFileCount.

Minor improvements of UI and training performance.

= 1.0.6 =

Training is now done in the background. When training has completed the menu
shows the "Training results" item until it is not visited once. This item is
also shown after automatic fast training.

Automatic fast training starts after updating the history file from the menu
and after opening not recent files from the smart history. It works in the
background and it is very fast (~50 times faster than full training).

Training result numbers do not include openings below Limit0: they are not
really important because they are the same as in the classic plain history.

= 1.0.5 =

Fix: plain history should be used on negative training results.

= 1.0.4 =

Fixed the plain history list and minor defects in 1.0.3.

= 1.0.3 =

* Use of closing time instead of opening time is better for a few reasons.
* Smart history list shows separators of the groups defined by factors.
* Training shows the progress form.
* Option Limits (see README).
* Ranking model is based on two factors instead of one. As a result:
- Training is slow but factors can live longer without re-training.
- Expected about 10% more total gain.

= 1.0.2 =

* Training is 2-4 times faster.
* Fixed recent time is 2 hours.
* Expected extra gain is about 15%.

= 1.0.1 =

* Key counts are used in ranking.
* Improved ranking model and training.
* Expected extra gain is more than 20%.
