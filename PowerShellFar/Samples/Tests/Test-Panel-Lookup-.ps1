	Test panel lookup actions

.Description
	Lookup panels are used by ListPanel when an object or a value has to be
	selected from a set represented by another, lookup panel.

	In this test try to press [Enter] on properties: at first to set a property
	value, then to change it. Note that in the latter case lookup panels should
	be normally shown with a current item properly positioned.

	[CtrlPgDn] can be used in both ListPanel and lookup panels. As usual it
	shows a list of object members (MemberPanel).
