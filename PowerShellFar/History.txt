"%FARLOCALPROFILE%\FarNet\PowerShellFar\PowerShellFarHistory.log".
The command history is created from Far Manager histories.
See https://github.com/nightroman/FarNet/discussions/31

Renamed and updated Complete-Word-.ps1 -> Complete-Word.ps1

= 6.0.14 =

= 6.0.8 =

Assert-Far [Debug] in addition to manually attached debugger (usually VSCode)
offers quick [Add-Debugger] session. Add-Debugger 2.1.0 is recommended.

= 6.0.7 =

Omit not so useful details in printed PowerShell errors,
better with default PowerShell $ErrorView='ConciseView'.
Full info is still available in many ways, when needed.

Start-FarTask debugging
- Requires Add-Debugger 2.0.0.
- New parameter AddDebugger replaces Break and specifies Add-Debugger's
parameters. It's verbose but flexible and works well when Add-Debugger
is used for different tasks. Use with wrappers and file associations:

	*.fas.ps1
	@ps: Start-FarTask -Script '!\!.!' -Step -AddDebugger @{Path="$env:TEMP\debug.log"; Environment='AddDebuggerFarTask'} #

Assert-Far
- Fixed [Debug], now debugger should stop at the line with Assert-Far
- Added [Ignore], not very safe (after assert) but may be very useful

= 6.0.6 =

Uses PowerShell SDK 7.2.6

Support ANSI colored console output. By default, enabled on Windows 10+.
Set $Psf.Settings.RemoveOutputRendering=$true/$false to disable/enable.

	Not just core commands output ANSI colors.
	You may craft some cool rendering, too, e.g.
	ps: $PSStyle.Background.BrightRed+'Power'+$PSStyle.Underline+$PSStyle.Bold+'Shell'+$PSStyle.Reset

Start-FarTask scripts debugging

	New switch Break tells to use Add-Debugger.ps1 and available breakpoints.
	Get from PSGallery https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Add-Debugger
	(use the latest)

	New switch Step implies Break and adds auto breakpoints for stopping at
	`job`, `ps:`, `run`, `keys`, `macro`.

	You may use two debuggers at the same time:
	- Add-Debugger for the task code (auto started on -Break / -Step).
	- VSCode debugger for code in `job`, `ps:`, `run` (attach manually).
	- Note, all breakpoints set in PowerShellFar work for both debuggers.
	  But each breakpoint usually works and makes sense for one of them.

= 6.0.5 =

- Use Wait-Debugger in Assert-Far and tweak
- Open-TextLink.ps1 - support ClearScript links

= 6.0.4 =

Obsolete members will be removed soon.
Adjust scripts working with panel files.

= 6.0.0 =

Requires FarNet 6 and uses .NET 6

FarNet 6 announcement -- https://github.com/nightroman/FarNet/pull/25

Main changes in PowerShell (module not changed much):
- It's PowerShell 7.2.5, not 5.1, some things are slightly different, mostly better.
- Module auto-import is no more, use Import-Module before calling its commands.
- WMI cmdlets are no more. CIM cmdlets replace them but they do not work yet.
- PowerShell jobs do not work yet, use Start-FarTask, better in many ways.

Session ApartmentState and script threads:

	The default apartment state is STA, like in other PowerShell hosts.
	Scripts are invoked in separate threads. Use the environment variable
	"PSF.ApartmentState" to change this:

	- "MTA", "STA" - set MTA/STA, invoke scripts in separate threads
	- "Unknown" - do not set ApartmentState, invoke scripts in the current thread

- 7za -> 7z in Bench/Update-FarManager.ps1

= 5.2.6 =

Use the current thread in the main runspace in order to deal with Far 3.0.5256.
Far 3.0.5260 reverts use of critical sections on every plugin call but we keep
our change for other similar problems in Far, e.g. in menus, see Mantis 2241.
Unfortunately we have to drop the ability to use different apartment states.

= 5.2.0 =

Adapt for Far 3.0.4782.
Retire command console.

= 5.1.0 =

Adapted for FarNet 5.1.0

= 5.0.94 =

Revision of TabExpansion2.ps1, prepare for future breaking changes.
See migration notes: https://github.com/nightroman/FarNet/issues/2

Invoke-Editor-.ps1
- ExecutionPolicy Bypass for all PS scripts.
- NoProfile for Invoke-Build scripts.

= 5.0.90 =

Recommended Far 3.0.4660+
Fixed command console exit.

= 5.0.89 =

Far does not support idle editor events.
Removed Watch-Output-.ps1 and Test-Watch-Output-.ps1.

= 5.0.88 =

DataTable:
- Do not auto hide some columns.
- Improved check for data changes.

Invoke-Editor-.ps1:
- Invoke-Build scripts: get tasks by ??, avoid some limitations.

= 5.0.87 =

Removed user items from the module menu, i.e removed $Psf.Action().
See forum: http://forum.farmanager.com/viewtopic.php?p=135651#p135651

= 5.0.86 =

Tree panel:
- Default panel view without description column
- Folder tree: better error message at Cert:\

TabExpansionProfile.ps1: fixed completer for git 2.5+

Test-Job-.ps1: adapted for PS v5

= 5.0.85 =

TabExpansion takes the prefix "ps:" into account not only in the command line
but also in dialogs (needed for user menu, apply command, file associations).

Search-Regex-.ps1: The parameter Options accepts some shortcuts:
sm: SimpleMatch, ww: WholeWord, etc.

= 5.0.84 =

Open-FarEditor, New-FarEditor, Open-FarViewer, and New-FarViewer resolve
relative input paths using the current PowerShell location.

= 5.0.83 =

Assert-Far: Refactoring and slightly changed logic. Special processing of
Conditions defined as a script block. See:
ps: help Assert-Far -full

Migration to GitHub: updated links.

= 5.0.82 =

Migration to GitHub. Some git commands are not friendly to "!" characters.
So the recommended stepper script suffix now is "..ps1". Renamed tests:
- Test-Dialog!.ps1 -> Test-Dialog..ps1
- Test-Stepper!.ps1 -> Test-Stepper..ps1

= 5.0.81 =

Update-FarManager.ps1
7za (standalone) is used instead of 7z (installed with 7-zip). If you do not
have 7za then define an alias to existing 7z.exe before calling the script:
> Set-Alias 7za <path>\7z.exe
> Update-FarManager.ps1 ...

Profile-Remote.ps1
The profile was expected on a remote machine (incorrect). Now it is read on the
current machine (correct) and then this code is invoked in a remote workspace.

Minor changes due to migration to GitHub, mostly in the documentation.

= 5.0.80 =

Show-History-.ps1
Removed work around unwanted Far messages on setting missing directories.

= 5.0.79 =

Adapted for Far 3.0.4138

= 5.0.78 =

Adapted for Far 3.0.4042 (new "Desktop" window).

= 5.0.77 =

PowerExplorer.Functions: SetText and SetFile are set automatically if AsSetText
and AsSetFile are assigned.

Panel-Mongo-.ps1: Can view [F3] and edit [F4] and save documents as JSON.
[F5] copies JSON to disk (not from).

= 5.0.76 =

Editor console & history: redraw on inserting commands from history.

= 5.0.75 =

Reindent-Selection-.ps1 - fixed for ExpandTabs mode

Update-FarManager.ps1 can remove some more not used files after updates.

= 5.0.74 =

Continued. [Esc] is for stopping in prompts for Type[] arguments as well.

= 5.0.73 =

STOPPING COMMANDS ON USER INPUT

In MS PS console [CtrlC] stops all commands on user input, i.e. on read host,
prompt for choice, etc. The same ability is added to PSF. But in PSF [Esc] is
used instead in various prompts. Unlike in PS, it also asks a user to confirm.

= 5.0.72 =

As far as Mantis#2635 is not going to be fixed, implemented a kludge.

NEW UPDATE TOOLS

Update-FarPackage.ps1 is replaced with the module FarPackage:
FarNet\Modules\PowerShellFar\Modules\FarPackage
See about_FarPackage.help.txt there.

Instead of one script with many not trivial parameters and rules these four
commands with simple parameters are used:

* Install-FarPackage   - installs/updates one package from web
* Restore-FarPackage   - installs one package from a file
* Update-FarPackage    - updates all installed packages
* Uninstall-FarPackage - removes one installed package

Intermediate unpacked directories "<PackageID>.<version>" are not used, you do
not have to clean after updates. Files are extracted from packages directly to
destinations.

Some packages slightly changed their structure, e.g. FarNet and PowerShellFar
moved information files to other directories.

If somebody wants some files to be excluded on unpacking we can support, say, a
file "Update.Exclude.txt" with relative paths and file masks to be excluded.
Think, suggest.

= 5.0.71 =

Command line and box: enabled path completion in both.

Menu "Errors": replaced \r\n\t in messages with spaces.

= 5.0.70 =

Update-FarPackage.ps1:
- Omitted FarHome is resolved to the current location if Far.exe is there.
- Verbose messages are replaced with Write-Host and always written.

Invoke-Editor-.ps1:
- amended current task recognition in *.{build|test}.ps1
- removed *-.ps1, redundant because there is [F5]

Invoke-Shortcut-.ps1: minor tweaks.

= 5.0.69 =

Use FarNet 5.0.46

Stepper: "Ask" mode shows step prompts at the top right corner of the window.

Removed menu "F11 \ PowerShellFar \ Modules+" as not useful anymore. In PS
v3.0+ modules does not have to be explicitly loaded for using commands. For
analysis of modules this command is more useful than the old menu:
ps: Get-Module -ListAvailable | Out-FarPanel

= 5.0.68 =

Use FarNet 5.0.45

Command console:
- Fixed missing cursor on cls.
- Fixed extra empty line on Read-Host.
- Fixed a conflict between console app output and prompt.

= 5.0.67 =

Command console:
- Nested prompt and debugger console also use command console prompt.
- Editor consoles are not used in command console mode (i.e. denied).

= 5.0.66 =

Command console:
- Fix: output from console apps could override prompt echo.
- Read-Host and Prompt(): prompt and echo use ":" in a new line.
- Like in MS, empty text exits prompts for multiple values (e.g. string[]).

TabExpansionProfile.ps1: Replaced demo completer of Far switches with more
practical completer of git commands, e.g. git [Tab]->all, git a[Tab]->a...

HLF file uses new syntax (Mantis#0002619). Recommended Far 3.0.3831.

= 5.0.65 =

Command console and "ps:" commands:
- Console apps with interaction and colors work as expected. In particular,
...|more works fine, git.exe commands work with colors and interaction, etc.

Execution policy:
- The module does not require Set-ExecutionPolicy in PowerShell.

= 5.0.64 =

Command console:
- Read-Host and Prompt(): fixed history and password.
- Show-FarTranscript uses the external viewer by default.
- Transcribing is off by default, use Start-Transcript, Show-FarTranscript.
- Start-Transcript, Stop-Transcript work like in MS with minor differences.

= 5.0.63 =

Command console:
- As in MS console, [F7] shows PowerShell command history.
- PromptForChoice: fixed formatting of long items.

PowerShell history:
- Default MaximumHistoryCount: 512 -> 1000.
- [Enter] inserts to command lines or a new command input box.
- [CtrlEnter] is not used.

Other:
- Added /w- to the default external viewer, i.e. Far /w- ...

= 5.0.62 =

Requires FarNet 5.0.42

Command console:
- UI (prompt, confirmation, choice) is mostly the same as in the MS PS console.
- Clicks outside of the input line are ignored (for now?) and do not exit.
- Too long prompts are not truncated but shown as read only edit boxes.
- [F4] Opens the modal editor for editing/pasting multiline code.
- Removed some AI on errors.

Complete-Word-.ps1: checks IsReadOnly.
Reformat-Selection-.ps1: checks IsLocked.

= 5.0.61 =

Implemented internals of "Read-Host -AsSecureString" properly with a password
edit box in UI and SecureString returned as a result.

Command console

The input line is shown at the line before the last in order to be there always
regardless of the key bar presence. As a result the last line is always empty,
for now. Later we can make it either the status line with some dynamic custom
information or maybe the special console mode tool bar.
** Suggestions and ideas are welcome **

Other tweaks:
- [F1] in empty command lines opens the help topic "Command input line".
- $Psf.StartConsole() throws an error if it is called not from panels.
- Key and menu bars are hidden/restored, as panels.

= 5.0.60 =

Requires FarNet 5.0.41

New feature/mode: "Command console"

The genuine console with the prompt implemented as one line input box with Far
history completion, PowerShell completion with [Tab], PowerShell help with
[F1], etc. It is like the standard PowerShell console but in many ways more
powerful with Far UI behind. This mode is started from the menu in panels.
[Esc] in the empty line exits back to panels.

You can run Far Manager with this mode started:
Far.exe /w ps:$Psf.StartConsole()

This mode is useful already. But a few touches will make it even better and
looking more like the standard console, with less surprises.

OTHER CHANGES

Simplified menu names. Hotkeys are not changed.

Improved processing of the debugger command "Quit".

Connect-SQLite-.ps1 requires System.Data.SQLite.1.0.91.0

Go-Head-.ps1 now always goes to the first file, not directory.

Test-Debugger.ps1 moved to https://github.com/nightroman/PowerShelf

= 5.0.59 =

Fixed an error on TabExpansion in a weird case (looks like a PS issue).

Update-FarPackage.ps1

- The script supports automatic updates using "Update.*.info" files.
- Added new parameter Source (Default: https://www.nuget.org/api/v2).
- Added new switch Remove which removes installed files.
- Improved potential error messages.

Internal. Replaced delegate GetValues with a Func<>.

= 5.0.58 =

Slightly simplified the NuGet package. It is recommended to update it by the
upgraded script Update-FarPackage.ps1

Upgraded Update-FarPackage.ps1. See the help comments for details and examples.
Summary:
- Revised and simplified parameter names.
- It can just get and return the latest version.
- It can just download and unpack without updating.
- Much faster unpacking by System.IO.Packaging (instead of Shell.Application).

= 5.0.57 =

THE PACKAGE MOVED TO NUGET

Update-FarPackage.ps1

New script Update-FarPackage.ps1 replaces Update-FarNet.ps1. The new script
installs or updates any NuGet package with special structure for Far Manager.
For now there are two packages "FarNet" and "FarNet.PowerShellFar". Other
FarNet modules will move to NuGet soon.

The script needs only PowerShell. It downloads packages by System.Net.WebClient
and unzips them by COM Shell.Application.

NOTE: Other authors can push their packages designed for Far to NuGet and use
this script for updates. This will work for native plugins, too. NuGet is for
.NET libraries in first place but packages can be created from any files, not
necessarily .NET related.

OTHER CHANGES

Removed the helper PowerShellFar.Wrap with methods ConverterToString and
Comparison. The first was needed for SubsetForm.ItemToString (not needed
anymore, script blocks can be used directly, see Test-SubsetForm-.ps1).
The second is not used, presumably.

Amended documentation comments for FarNetAPI.chm

RENAMED:
- Test-Dialog+.ps1 -> Test-Dialog!.ps1
- Test-Stepper+.ps1 -> Test-Stepper!.ps1

REASON: OPC packages (NuGet) escape some characters (e.g. "+" becomes "%2B").
Update-FarPackage.ps1 and NuGet.exe decode such names correctly but on manual
unzipping such names will be problematic. We better avoid "+" and use another
symbol which is not escaped, say, "!".

= 5.0.56 =

Fixed TabExpansion in the editor console opened from the debugger dialog.

Script Connect-SQLite-.ps1 - Redesigned for use of the NuGet package and the
env var (can be set globally or in a profile). This is more portable and does
not require installation of assemblies to GAC or registration of the provider.

Fixed several issues in database demo scripts.

= 5.0.55 =

INITIALIZATION

Internal changes in session initialization. Like in ISE and ConsoleHost v3, the
default apartment state is STA. As a result, for example, it is possible to use
System.Windows.Forms.Clipboard, WPF forms, and other features that require STA.

NOTE: If MTA is still required set the env var: PSF.ApartmentState=MTA. Please,
report such cases, perhaps a better option is needed.

NOTE: New initialization caused an insignificant change in one test. If you
notice any significant changes in PowerShellFar behaviour, please report.

OTHER CHANGES

Amended items in completion lists for commands and provider items.

= 5.0.54 =

Fixed incorrect comparison of keys (transition to Far3, v5.0.0). E.g. break
keys in some menus did not work.

Fixed issues in the "Background job" dialog shown on Far exit with existing
jobs. Used the PSF external viewer instead of Notepad for viewing jobs output.

Added the switch /ro to the default PSF external viewer command, so it is:
<this-far.exe> /ro /m /p /v <file>

= 5.0.53 =

NOTE: Simple manual upgrade steps may be needed.

CONFIGURATION VIA PROFILES

PowerShellFar is configured via profiles with special fixed names located in
"%FARPROFILE%\FarNet\PowerShellFar". Each profile is invoked on the relevant
event, once per session. Profiles are invoked in the global scope.

HOW TO UPGRADE. Rename profile scripts and copy them to the profile directory.
Cosmetic changes may be needed depending on how profiles were called before.

Supported profiles:
- Profile.ps1        - use new or upgraded
- Profile-Editor.ps1 - use new or upgraded
- Profile-Local.ps1  - new feature
- Profile-Remote.ps1 - new feature

"Profile.ps1" is the main session profile invoked on loading PowerShellFar. It
replaces the old setting "StartupCode". Renamed "Profile-.ps1" to "Profile.ps1".

"Profile-Editor.ps1" is the editor profile invoked on the first use of editor.
It replaces the old setting "StartupEdit". Renamed "Profile-Editor-.ps1" to
"Profile-Editor.ps1".

NEW: "Profile-Local.ps1" and "Profile-Remote.ps1" are session profiles invoked
on opening local and remote editor consoles, once per each new session.

Updated the manual and added the new topic "Profiles".

If the old file "%FARPROFILE%\FarNet\PowerShellFar\Settings.resources" exists
remove it because PowerShellFar does not have any settings saved there now.

CODE COMPLETION IN LOCAL AND REMOTE CONSOLES

TabExpansion2/TabExpansion which is used in the main session is enabled in
local and remote editor consoles, too. It is also initialized on the first
completion and the same completer rules and expansion profiles are used.

Fixed some code completion issues in remote consoles.

= 5.0.52 =

TabExpansion

- Like in ISE, completion list items can be different from their completion
texts (e.g. shorter, without common leading parts, etc.).

TabExpansionProfile.ps1, Type/Namespace completion

- Fixed cases of incorrect replacement on type name completion.
- Like in ISE, completion lists show ListItemText instead of CompletionText.

= 5.0.51 =

Multiline commands in PowerShell editor consoles

- Like in ISE, [ShiftEnter] just adds a new line without invoking the command.
- [Enter] at any position of the last command area invokes the whole area code.
- As a result, it is possible to paste multiline code and invoke it by [Enter].
- Introduced the marker line <> for empty output. It is needed now in order to
separate commands because they are not one-liners anymore.
- Multiline commands are not added to the history.
- Updated TabExpansion for multiline commands.
- Updated editor console help.
- Updated powershell.hrc in order to recognize the new marker <>.

= 5.0.50 =

Code completion in script editors

- Covered statements that continue after the current line.
- Corrected completion of variables from the current script.

= 5.0.49 =

Code completion in script editors analyses not just the current line but the
whole code, e.g. completion in multiline statements including continued lines
(` at EOL) should work fine.

TabExpansion2.ps1

- Improved diagnostics of user profile and completer issues like unexpected
output and invalid result type. Errors are silent, examine $Error on problems.

TabExpansionProfile.ps1

- Completion of Find-FarFile:Name takes into account pre-typed parts.
- Completion of help comment tags (.Synopsis, etc.) works in ISE, too.
- Improved completion of "one line code" in comments, also works in ISE.

= 5.0.48 =

TabExpansionProfile.ps1, TabExpansion2.ps1

- Completion in comments moved from TabExpansion2 to TabExpansionProfile. In
other words, it is up to a user. TabExpansion2 is now just a bare engine for
invoking completers added by profiles.
- Completion of help comments (.Synopsis, etc.) is for FarHost only. It's
complicated in ISE and useless in console.
- Improved work around read only built-in results.

= 5.0.47 =

TabExpansionProfile.ps1, TabExpansion2.ps1, TabExpansion.ps1

- Special processing of results for ISE lists (V3).
- Type/namespace order: namespaces first, types second.
- Generic types are completed with "[]", "[,]", etc. at ends.
- Faster type and namespace completions, even with new features.
- Added ResultType to New-CompletionResult and used in completers accordingly.
NB: If you use ISE, this value is important for icons in ISE completion lists.
- Magic. TabExpansionProfile.ps1 Out-FarPanel completer gets properties, try:
Get-Process | Out-FarPanel [Tab]

= 5.0.46 =

TabExpansion2

- Removed $token parameter from result processors.
- Upgraded TabExpansionProfile.ps1 result processors accordingly.
- Added support for InputProcessors in addition to ResultProcessors.
- Added one custom input processor which completes .NET types and namespaces
like TabExpansion.ps1 does. Personally, this way is much more useful than the
built-in completion.

Search-Regex-.ps1

- Extra options:
* SimpleMatch instead of the old trick *pattern.
* WholeWord ensures word bounds at pattern start/end words.

- Command line mode: if InputObject is specified and it is a script block then
it will be invoked in the background for getting input files. Analogue in UI:
"Input" command + "Background input" checked.

= 5.0.45 =

TabExpansion2 for PowerShell v3

New script TabExpansion2.ps1 in the module home directory is automatically used
for PowerShell v3. The old TabExpansion.ps1 is also there, it is used for
PowerShell v2.

There are many new useful features. One of the best (personally) is argument
completion for some popular cmdlets and ability to add custom completers for
external or even build-in commands.

TabExpansion2.ps1, unlike the old one, supports custom extensions via profiles.
New script Bench\TabExpansionProfile.ps1 is a profile used by the author. Use
it as the base for your own. See the script comments and code for the details.

Custom completers are new and some features may change, like rules for result
completers. Other completers are more or less standard, they are less likely
going to change.

Removed Test-TabExpansion-.ps1 from the package. It's a boring test now.

= 5.0.44 =

TabExpansion

- Improved expansion of types and namespaces. Removed type caching, all works
fast enough. As a result, types added later are processed without re-caching.

- If a type name contains any wildcard character then a search for all types is
performed. '*' is not added to end as it used to be, so that it is possible to
search for types which names "end with". E.g. [*client<Tab> gets types which
names end with 'client'.

- Special "#". WORD#<Tab> is used for command history, like in the console
host. Expansion gets commands containing WORD.

- Special "=". WORD=<Tab> is used for lines from TabExpansion.txt from the same
directory as TabExpansion.ps1. Expansion gets lines containing WORD and sets
the cursor to the symbol "#", if any. Old TabExpansion#.txt can be removed.

NOTE: Special "#" and "=" should work in other hosts if TabExpansion.ps1 is
used there. Tested with Microsoft PowerShell console and ISE hosts.

NOTE: This is probably the last PS V2 compatible TabExpansion. It will continue
to exist and work for V2 but for V3 TabExpansion2 will be used. New development
will be there. Some new features are coming soon.

= 5.0.43 =

TabExpansion: Fixed issues on not yet imported module command parameters.

Improved cmdlet help for panels, especially Out-FarPanel.

Internal: Removed scriptblock cache. PS V3 uses its own.

= 5.0.42 =

Object panel: Take into account possible problematic objects with some
properties or ToString() throwing exceptions.

TabExpansion: Avoided redundant parts in choice menu items in some cases.

Update-FarManager.ps1, Update-FarNet.ps1: parameter Platform: default value
(x86|x64) is taken from Far.exe file info.

Panel-Mongo-.ps1: Adapted for the latest Mdbc. Added support of file collections.

= 5.0.41 =

Improved navigation of KeyValuePair's in object and member panels.

= 5.0.40 =

Improved view and navigation of DictionaryEntry's in object and member panels.
Object panel: [Enter] on DictionaryEntry opens a panel for its Value, if it is
not trivial, [CtrlPgDn] as usual opens a member panel. Member panel: only "Key"
and "Value" are shown, "Name" is removed (redundant PowerShell alias of "Key").

Fixed "Cannot access a disposed object." in a dialog of remote session console.

Script Invoke-Editor-.ps1. If a file is *.build|test.ps1 then the current task
is invoked by Invoke-Build.ps1 (https://github.com/nightroman/Invoke-Build)

Script Complete-Word-.ps1. Redraw the editor on insertion to avoid delays.

Scripts Update-FarManager.ps1, Update-FarNet.ps1 - either parameter or env
variable FARHOME is mandatory. Default "C:\Program Files\Far" is not used.

= 5.0.39 =

Fixed a few defects caused by new prefixes ps:, vps: (e.g. TabExpansion, etc.).

Minor, mostly internal, changes in PSF background jobs.

= 5.0.38 =

Changed default command prefixes ">:" to "ps:" and ">>:" to "vps:". If you want
to use the old prefixes go to Options\Plugins configuration\FarNet\Commands and
change the prefixes there.

= 5.0.37 =

Technical build for FarNet 5.0.34.

= 5.0.36 =

* Removed Show-KeyMap.ps1, it does not work with new Far macros.
* Select-Bookmark-.ps1 - call Redraw() after setting the position.

= 5.0.33 =

Improved TabExpansion of variables in a script in the editor for variables with
prefixes `$script:`, `$global:`, and `$private:`.

Moved some not PSF scripts to https://github.com/nightroman/PowerShelf
They are useful with or without Far and will be maintained separately.
* Add-Path.ps1
* Format-Chart.ps1
* Invoke-Environment.ps1
* Set-Console.ps1 (as Set-ConsoleSize.ps1)

= 5.0.32 =

= 5.0.30 =

Expansion of variables (TabExpansion) also uses variables from the current file
(usually a script) in the editor in addition to existing session variables.

Show-KeyMap.ps1
* Default output file is $env:TEMP\FarKeyMap.output.htm

Invoke-Editor-.ps1
* Amended invocation of .ps1 files in an external console

= 5.0.29 =

Module FarDescription does not depend on Far2 registry settings. The settings
are defined in `FarDescription.psm1`. See `about_FarDescription.help.txt` for
details.

Script `Update-FarNet.ps1`
* Removed check for running Far instances. It was troublesome in some cases.

= 5.0.28 =

Adapted for the new macro engine in Far 3.0.2853. Scripts using hardcoded
macros (e.g. stepper scripts) should be adapted, as well as other used macros.

= 5.0.27 =

Panel-Mongo-.ps1
* [ShiftF6] Prompts for a new name and renames the current collection.

Reviewed and tested for PowerShell V3 RC.

= 5.0.26 =

Panel-Mongo-.ps1 (requires Mdbc module v2.0.0)
* It can delete selected databases, collections, documents. DISCLAIMER: usual,
see in the script. Thus, in addition to browsing you can also prune your data.
NB: changes of document data in panels are ignored.
* Specific content. New parameters DatabaseName, CollectionName allow opening
collections of the specified database or documents of the specified collection.

Minor supportive changes in the PSF core.

= 5.0.25 =

New script Panel-Mongo-.ps1, the browser of MongoDB databases, collections, and
documents, including nested data. Requires MongoDB + Mdbc. Simple, fast, cool.

DataPanel (universal SQL database data browser) uses new FarNet paging instead
of implementing its own. Removed "Next / Previous Range" from the [F1] menu.
For paging simply use "smart" [PgDn] and [PgUp].

Debugger dialog: renamed Break -> Quit (like in the console debugger).

TabExpansion expands $*xxx[tab]. Added a test.

= 5.0.24 =

The stepper engine uses new IFar.PostSteps().

Adapted scripts to changes in `powershell.hrc`.

= 5.0.20 =

the PowerShellFar package. It is distributed separately as the ColorerPack
package among other FarNet packages.

= 5.0.18 =

Improved powershell.hrc for Colorer
- Renamed PowerShell to powershell (Colorer style), update your prototype file.
- powershell:regions instead of def:regions (colors can be customized in .hrd).
- Comment inherits def:Comment => TODO, URL, Email, bug, fix, ??, !!
- Backtick at EOL is the region LineWrap.
- Added yet missing escaped "" in "...".
- Improved psfconsole output.

Get-TextLink-.ps1
- Gets the link + selected text, if any.

Open-TextLink-.ps1
- VS link: also uses the next editor line as a hint.
- In markdown files can jump to internal link targets.

= 5.0.17 =

FarDescription module and Edit-FarDescription-.ps1
(description tools and multi-line editor)

- Do not trim, keep text as it is.
- Do not preselect 1-line descriptions.
- Use temp names like "name.ext.description.txt" and enable editor history.
Thus, it is much more convenient to edit descriptions - texts are opened at
last saved positions and Colorer adds some colors for .txt. Distinctive name
can be used by other tools (e.g. RightWords for spelling checks on opening).

Show-Markdown-.ps1
- Amended the anchor pattern.

Reformat-Selection-.ps1
- Amended formatting of markdown lists.

Indent-Selection-.ps1
- Renamed the switch Outdent -> Back.
- It can work with any custom prefix, e.g. '> ' (quotations in markdown).

Show-Hlf-.ps1
- @+ @- should not be treated as topic anchors.

RomanConsole.hrd
- Changed def:Tag color so that it is different from def:Text.
(BTW, the original standard White scheme has the same "defect").

= 5.0.16 =

Settings
- $Psf.Settings.EditorConsoleEndOutputScript = 'Get-Date'
The script is invoked after each editor console command, its output is
converted to strings and written to the editor console.

Markdown tools
- Reformat-Selection-.ps1: formatting of markdown list items.
- Markdown scripts support .text, .md, .markdown extensions.

Select-Bookmark-.ps1 adapted to FarNet changes.

Search-FarFile checks masks for validity.

= 5.0.15 =

* About
- Replaced "Readme.txt" with "About-PowerShellFar.htm" which is generated from
the same source as "PowerShellFar.hlf".

* Markdown & markdown help tools
- Requires HelpDown
- New script Show-Markdown-.ps1 opens markdown as HTML or Far help.
- Invoke-Editor-.ps1 opens markdown files from editors as HTML, at the topic.
- Profile-Editor-.ps1 opens markdown files from editors as HLF, at the topic.

= 5.0.12 =

= 5.0.11 =

Tweaks in PowerShell breakpoint related code.

= 5.0.9 =

cases not yet processed correctly due to the nature of Far change events.
- Breakpoint highlighting is based on new drawers engine + fixed minor defects.
- Removed Draw-Word-.ps1 (it is replaced by the new FarNet module Drawer).
- Test-EditorDrawer-.ps1 -> Test-RegisterDrawer-.ps1

*) Assert-Far
- Changed order of buttons and disabled cancel.

= 5.0.6 =

*) Stepper (engine for tests and super-macros)
- Steps may return script blocks (modal steps), other output is an error.
- New cmdlet Invoke-FarStepper for running stepper scripts easier.
- New Stepper.AddFile(), Stepper.Data & automatic variable $Data.
- Removed $Psf.Go(), Stepper.AskDefault, Stepper.PostUnit().
- More information on errors.

*) PowerShellFar.farconfig
- Minor tweaks of some macros (e.g. about Mantis 1700).

= 5.0.5 =

*) Histories come back
- Complete-Word-.ps1 uses command/dialog history again.
- Show-History-.ps1 comes back.

*) Misc

- *-FarEditor cmdlets allow empty file names

= 5.0.3 =

not updated when scripts change. To be continued, hopefully with this:
http://bugs.farmanager.com/view.php?id=1981

= 5.0.2 =

- Fixed Edit-FarDescription-.ps1

= 5.0.0 =

This version is designed for Far Manager 3 + FarNet 5.

There are breaking changes and some scripts have to be updated. See FarNet
history for details and new FarNet API documentation.

Some PSF features were removed (forever or not may depend on the feedback):
- FarMacro module and its cmdlets (*-FarMacro).
- Far history is not supported by scripts.
