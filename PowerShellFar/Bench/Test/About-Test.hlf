PREREQUISITES

*) Include the directory Bench to the path. Tests may call scripts from there.

*) Some tests should be initialized. For example database tests need some data
to work with. Invoke Initialize-Test-.ps1 before such tests.

You can invoke Test-Panel-DbText-.ps1 without preparations. See the script
comments for details.

*) Other scripts are designed for and tested with SQL Server Express (instance
".\sqlexpress", e.g. installed with Visual Studio), SQL Server Compact
(installed with Visual Studio), and SQLite (http://system.data.sqlite.org/).

*) If your SQL Server is different, change the connection string in
Initialize-Test-.ps1, see $DbConnection.ConnectionString = ..

*) Invoke Initialize-Test-.ps1 to create a mini-database with two tables.

	For SQL Server Express it creates two related tables in Tempdb: TestNotes
	and TestCategories. After tests drop the tables manually or just leave
	them, they will be removed automatically when the server restarts.

	For SQL Server Compact or SQLite it creates in %TEMP% the file Tempdb.sdf
	or Tempdb.sqlite and adds the same tables and data. You may remove these
	files after tests.

Now you are ready to play with scripts. Recommended sequence:

1) Run Panel-DbTable-.ps1 (from Bench), if everything is fine you get all
tables in your Tempdb including TestNotes and TestCategories. Open them by
[Enter] and see how they look in basic mode (i.e. without any customisation).
Note that you can even perform all operations like insert, delete and update
([F7], [Del], etc.)

2) Run Test-Panel-DbCategories-.ps1 - the table looks different, not much, but
the field CategoryId is hidden because a user normally should not use or even
see it, this information is internal.

3) Run Test-Panel-DbNotes-.ps1 - it looks more different (two fields are
hidden). The important point is that how you modify Category. When you [Enter]
on it Test-Panel-DbCategories-.ps1 is actually called and the table
TestCategories is opened for selection of another category. At the same time
you can modify or add new categories as if you opened it directly in step 2).

#KNOWN ISSUES#

If you are about to delete or modify again just added and saved record then at
first you have to re-read the table data explicitly by <CtrlR> (otherwise you
can get concurrency error or record data can be incomplete and etc.).

The script Test-Dialog-.ps1 demonstrates most of features and functionality
available in FarNet dialogs. It

	- creates a dialog and sets a help topic from a file in the same folder;
	- adds most of available FarNet dialog items and their different forms;
	- sets items properties before Show() and after Show() (see [Code]);
	- adds a number of various dialog and item event handlers;
	- sets focused and default item and starts Show().
	- shows how to emulate IDialog.MouseClicked event.
	- shows how to use and draw IUserControl.

#[Done]#

When the dialog is closed by [Done] (default button) the script outputs some
occurred events information and current data of the dialog and items.

#[Fail]#

This is just a test of what happens on an error in an event handler.

#[Test]#

Automated test. It invokes steps from the super-macro "Test-Dialog+.ps1" in
ask-mode so that you can watch each step code or keys and see how each step
works. At any time you may choose [Cancel] to stop stepping or [Continue] to
play the rest of steps automatically.

#[List]#

Extra test of three list controls (combo edit, combo box, list box). The code
shows how to use DetachItems(), AttachItems() for better performance when
changes are large enough.

#[More]#

This button starts the same dialog to show it is fine to open nested dialogs.

#[Exit]#

'Cancel' button (property IDialog.Cancel): if it is pushed Show() returns false.

#F11 \ PowerShellFar \ Invoke input code#

You can invoke PowerShell commands from dialogs. Thus, you can test a dialog
and its items manually running PowerShell code right there. Variables defined
is the dialog script are available. For example you can enter and run:

	$dialog ## gets this dialog properties;
	$e1 ## gets the first edit control properties;
	$e1.Text = 'New text' ## sets some new text in it;
	$e1.Disabled = 1 ## disabled it
	$lb.Items.RemoveAt(0) ## remove the first list box item
