        <summary>
            Calls the As.. script if any or the Do.. method.
        </summary>
    </ScriptFork>
    <Columns>
        <summary>
            Columns definitions. Set it only when the panel has no files.
        </summary>
        <remarks>
            Items of this array are similar to <c>Format-Table</c> parameter <c>-Property</c> items.
            Strings define properties and the same column names; hashtables provide more information:
            properties or script blocks, column titles, widths, types, and format strings.
            See <see cref="Meta"/> remarks about use of dictionaries as items
            and <see cref="PanelPlan.Columns"/> about column types.
            <para>
                Columns of <see cref="DataPanel"/> can be mapped only to properties,
                that is to data table fields. Script blocks are not supported.
            </para>
            <para>
                Special case: 'N' column (Name) of <see cref="ItemPanel"/> is always mapped to the <c>PSChildName</c>
                for providers with container items (e.g. Registry). For this column any custom data source is ignored.
                But it has to be included to describe other information: position, title, width, format string.
                Note: if column types are not specified then normally the first column is treated as 'N'.

    <AddLookup>
        <summary>
            Adds a lookup handler.
        </summary>
        <param name="name">
            Name of a <see cref="ListPanel"/> file.
        </param>
        <param name="handler">Handler of [Enter] on a file.</param>
        <remarks>
            <para>
                These handles are used by <see cref="ListPanel"/> but often they are added to
                <see cref="TablePanel"/> and then internally passed in its child <see cref="ListPanel"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
                Example: if this is a <see cref="DataPanel"/> then the added handler will be called when
                [Enter] is pressed on its child <see cref="MemberPanel"/> file with the specified name.
                Normally the task of this handler is to start another table containing values to be selected
                and to set a handler triggered on [Enter] there (see <see cref="Lookup"/>).
                Example script: <c>Test-Panel-DbNotes-.ps1</c>.
