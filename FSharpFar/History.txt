Engage F# v6 features in samples and tests.

	If you use Visual Studio, 2022 is recommended for working with sources.
	VS 2019 with the old F# compiler may not recognise some new syntax.
	(reminder: VS is not needed for running F# script in FSF)

Associate .fsproj with Visual Studio 2022

	On problems with associating .fsproj files with Visual Studio 2022, use this registry tweak:

		HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\fsproj_auto_file\shell\open\command
		"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe" "%1"

See README "Using fsx.exe tool" and "repo/samples/fsx-sample".

The interactive session configuration object `fsi` is available for scripts.
Use it for customization and for `fsi.CommandLineArgs` in fsx.exe or fsi.exe.

The compiler symbol FARNET is defined for scripts loaded by FSharpFar.
It is used for conditional compilation to separate FarNet | non-FarNet.

= 1.9.21 =

"Project" commands: generated projects include *.fsx scripts.

= 1.9.20 =

clearly show the locations in code, unlike often cryptic F# stack traces of
usual exceptions.

New FarNet.FSharp.Window methods, just helpers, no new functionality.

Use new Assert and Window methods in tests in "samples".

FSharp.Core (4.6.2)

= 1.9.2 =

The default sessions / configurations are now used instead of the main.
The main is still default for directories with no configuration files.

API
- Add more Job helper functions for panels.
- Add demo in samples\Async\TestPanel02.fs.
- Job.FlowDialog - change parameters style.

= 1.9.1 =

FSharp.Core (4.6.1)

FSharp.Compiler.Service (26.0.1) supports all F# 4.6 features, see
https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2019/01/24/announcing-f-4-6-preview/
Example: "samples\PowerShellFar\PanelObjects.fsx" uses anonymous records.

Tidy up commands and logic with configurations. If a config file is specified
then it must exist. If a directory is searched for config files then the first
in alphabetical order is used. If there is none then either the main config is
used or an error is thrown, depending on an operation.

= 1.8.2 =

- Requires FarNet 5.2.18
- FSharp.Core (4.6), FSharp.Compiler.Service (25.0.1)

= 1.8.1 =

= 1.8.0 =

New config file section [use] allows using other config files in the current.
You can easily compose a session with existing "projects" and new settings.

"Project" opens the main session if there is no config in the current folder.

Add `PowerShellFar.invokeScript`. See "samples\PowerShellFar" in the repo.

Add samples\Lib\SessionVariables.fs, SessionVariablesPanel.fsx

= 1.7.0 =

New menu command "Project" makes a special project from your config file and
opens it, usually in Visual Studio. You get the full power for composing your
files. You do not have to build anything and restart Far in order to test the
changes. Just edit, save, and run F# files in this special project.
See README for details.

Retire tools/Convert-Project.ps1, not so useful now.

FSharp.Core 4.5.4.

= 1.6.2 =

`[F5]` in editors is shortcut for `[F11]` \ `FSharpFar` \ `Load`

= 1.6.1 =

Add job helper: job {...} ~ Job.From (fun () -> ...)
Rework Job methods.

= 1.6.0 =

FarNet API moved to FarNet\FarNet.FSharp.dll. It is automatically available for
scripts as usual and F# FarNet modules, when referenced. Modules do not have to
reference the whole FSharpFar.dll.

= 1.5.7 =

- Rework Async tools with samples and tests
- FSharp.Core (4.5.2)

= 1.5.6 =

Requires FarNet 5.2.13

- FSharp.Compiler.Service (23.0.3)
- FSharp.Core (4.5)

= 1.5.5 =

= 1.5.3 =

Requires FarNet 5.2.11+

- FCS 21.0.1, FSharp.Core 4.4.3.0
- Fix completion in interactive.

= 1.5.2 =

FCS 17.0.1

= 1.5.1 =

- //exec: file is optional, `with + code` is often enough and more effective.
- Convert-Project.ps1: fixes.

= 1.5.0 =

New command `fs: //compile` lets to compile a dll or exe right in FSF without
anything else installed like Visual Studio, VSCode, even F#. In other words,
you can make FarNet modules written in F# just with FSF.

Updated repo/samples/TryPanelFSharp, see how to compile a module in FSF.

Changes in configuration format (BREAKING): (1) Options are used in the same
way as for "fsc.exe" and "fsi.exe", one option per line, instead of the old
"name=value" format. (2) Source files are normally specified in [fsc], not
[fsi]. (3) Relative paths do not have to start with "." (but "--reference"
or "-r" still requires this).

Overall, the new format is simpler (you can literally copy paste VS F# build
output pieces to the [fsc] section) and yet flexible to describe three modes:
interactive, compiling, editor services. See README for the details.

Updated repo/tools/Convert-Project.ps1

= 1.4.2 =

FarNet 5.2.6

Improve tips, especially when an XML doc file is available:
- Tips called from the menu are formatted a la help and shown in an editor.
- Auto tips message has the button [More] which shows full tips in an editor.
- Try to get not found framework v4.6.2 XML doc files from a different location.

= 1.4.1 =

Improve diagnostics on session errors. When a script is loaded or invoked and
fails due to upstream session errors then these errors should be shown first.
Otherwise, script own errors look cryptic.

Minor improvements in checker and config parser.

Convert-Project.ps1: avoid redundant references.

FarNet directory is no longer predefined as --lib. It turns out Far home
directory is predefined as --lib by FCS. So FarNet as --lib is redundant.

= 1.4.0 =

Far Manager 3.0.5013
FarNet 5.2.5

Moved to the latest FCS 14.0.2 and FSharp.Core 4.2.3. This enables F# 4.1 in Far.

Removed partial support of .fsproj, MSBuild, and ProjectCracker. Support becomes
difficult and the value is low. If you have .fsproj then just use VS or VSCode.
Auto loaded/used files are dropped, too, they were designed for .fsproj cases.

"repo/tools/Convert-Project.ps1" converts .fsproj to .fs.ini for FSharpFar.
It requires FSharp.Compiler.Service.ProjectCracker, see comments for help.

Other changes

- Moved "Async.fs" from samples to the core for checks and tips.
- Auto checks and tips in F# sources are enabled by default.
- Redesigned "samples/Async" and added tests to "App2.fs".

= 1.3.0 =

- FCS 13.0.0
- Amend config errors
- Improve editor checks and rendering
- Predefine "FSharpFar.dll" reference
- Add `FarNet.Auto` -> `open FarNet` gives `far`
- Add "Async" samples with Far Manager async flows

Code in "samples/Async/Async.fs" will be eventually included to the core.
This is some very useful stuff but the development is still in progress.

= 1.2.8 =

Errors are highlighted on auto checks and checks from the menu.
Error messages are shown when the mouse hovers over error areas.

= 1.1.0 =

Auto tips on mouse moves over symbols.
Use "F11 \ FSharpFar \ Enable auto tips" in F# editors.

= 1.0.4 =

Errors on loading interactive sessions are written to the editor.

= 1.0.3 =

Fix #10, scripts of F# projects should use the main config.

= 1.0.2 =

Fix #9, completion of identifiers with double-backticks.

= 1.0.1 =

- Amended processing of paths in //exec and //open.
- //exec uses the config from the script folder.
- Added "samples" to the repository.

= 1.0.0 =

FSharpFar requires just Far Manager, FarNet, and .NET Framework 4.5+.

MSBuild is not needed, thanks to FCS 8.0.0., unless you are using .fsproj
project files for configurations. FSharp.Core is included to the package.

= 0.10.0 =

Interactive

	Generated file names with time stamps are used for interactives.
	You may save interactive files but they are not supposed to be
	reused as interactives.

	Interactive input is stored in a common history file.
	Use [F6] in order to get the interactive history.

Misc

	"Load" uses local .fs.ini and .fsproj, if any.
	Fix a cache error on using updated config files.

= 0.9.0 =

Symbol definitions and references
- Menu "Uses in file" shows uses in the file
- Menu "Uses in project" show uses in the project

= 0.8.1 =

Tips
- Use info from XML docs.

= 0.8.0 =

fs: //open

	Support ".fsproj" as interactive configuration in addition to ".fs.ini".
	Currently all compiled ".fs" files are automatically loaded.
	This is very handy on developing small projects.
	This is slow and rather useless for large.

Auto #load and #use

	On opening interactive with "config.ext", existing files "config.load.fsx"
	and "config.use.fsx" are automatically loaded and used as input. This is
	designed for "config.fsproj" but works for "config.ini" as well.

fs: //exec ... [;; <F# code>]

	Support an optional F# code invoked after loading a file.
	This is the official way to call something with parameters.

= 0.7.1 =

- Improve code completion.
- Avoid opening a session on checks.
- Cache INI configurations on checking.
- Fix conflict between F# and FSF commands.
- Add a sanity check on reading INI config.

Show session loading progress state and title.
fsi.exe does not have to be in the path.

= 0.3.0 =

Use Far 3.0.4775, its FarColorer supports F# syntax highlighting.

The new menu command "Load" in editor saves and loads the current script in the
main session. Its output, warnings, and errors are shown in another editor.

Code completion in editors works for all F# files. Completions is currently
based on the main session, you may configure it using "main.fsi.ini".

Amended //exec for scripts with console output functions (printf, etc.)
So //exec is fine for all scripts, except dealing with console directly.

= 0.2.0 =

Revised the module and F# sessions.
Added commands //exec and //open.
Updated README.

= 0.1.0 =

Code completion by [Tab] in F# interactive editors.
