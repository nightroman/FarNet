FarNet module for Far Manager editor configuration

## Installation

- Package [FarNet.EditorKit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FarNet.EditorKit/)

https://github.com/nightroman/FarNet#readme

## Description

EditorKit uses `.editorconfig` files (see [EditorConfig]) and its own settings
for extras (see [Module settings](#module-settings)).

What is EditorConfig?

> EditorConfig helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers
working on the same project across various editors and IDEs. EditorConfig files
are easily readable and they work nicely with version control systems.

### Supported settings

```ini
trim_trailing_whitespace = true | false
insert_final_newline = true | false
indent_style = tab | space
indent_size = <number>
charset = utf-8 | utf-8-bom | utf-16le | utf-16be
```

If a file opened in editor does not have some settings or they are set to
unsupported values then the module does nothing and Far Manager current
settings apply.
