NuGet package: https://www.nuget.org/packages/FarNet.RightWords

= 2.1.5 =

Amended package information.

= 2.1.4 =

NHunspell 1.1.1 is now included to the package.

The package moved to NuGet.

= 2.1.3 =

Upgraded for NHunspell 1.1.0
http://sourceforge.net/projects/nhunspell/files/NHunspell.1.1.0.0.zip/download

= 2.1.2 =

Adapted for FarNet 5.0.31

= 2.1.1 =

The storage of the optional setting UserDictionaryDirectory changed from
local to roaming (by a user request, to improve portability). If this path
was set before then it has to be set again and the old *.local.settings
file can be removed, UserDictionaryDirectory was the only local setting.

= 2.1.0 =

FarNet 5.0.9 with centralized drawer infrastructure. As a result:
- Menu item "Highlighting" moved to the FarNet drawers menu.
- "Auto highlighting file mask" moved to the FarNet options.
- See RightWords.macro.lua for the updated "Highlighting" macro.

= 2.0.5 =

Use FarNet 5.0.8 with amended drawer API.

= 2.0.4 =

Use FarNet 5.0.7 with amended drawer API.

= 2.0.3 =

Use FarNet 5.0.3. Simplified and yet faster work with editor colors.

= 2.0.2 =

Fixed highlighting defects on editing with spelling errors without Colorer.

= 2.0.1 =

Use FarNet 5.0.1. Bug fixing.

= 2.0.0 =

Adapted for Far3 + FarNet5.

= 1.0.10 =

Use FarNet 4.5.0

Fixed rare but possible dupes in the suggestion and dictionary menus.

The WordPattern setting: all regular expression capturing groups "(...)"
are removed from the word before spell-checking. This is used for checking
spelling of words with embedded "noise" parts, like the hotkey markers "&"
in .lng files. See About-RightWords for details and the example pattern
with "&".

Added "*.lng" to the default automatic highlighting file mask.

= 1.0.9 =

Added UserDictionaryDirectory to settings (optional). Unlike the other
settings it is local, it is stored in the local module settings, not the
roaming.

The UI is localized (English, Russian).

= 1.0.8 =

[Correct word] menu is shown one line lower (the word is visible more
often).

[Add to Dictionary] | Common: a user is asked to add one or two word forms.

Changed the default WordPattern and the sample SkipPattern (see Readme).

Fixed double added colors in the current line on highlighting.

= 1.0.7 =

[Add to Dictionary] command supports the common and language dictionaries.
See About-RightWords for details. This feature is very useful but it is not
that simple.

Ignore the `Native Library is already loaded` exception. It is possible in
rare cases when other modules use NHunspell and load it before RightWords.

= 1.0.6 =

Use FarNet 4.4.21 (revised editor color API).

Highlighting is tested with and without the Colorer plugin and without
other editor color plugins. Scenarios with other editor color plugins are
not tested.

Highlighting is turned on automatically for files which names match the
mask: [F9] | Options | Plugins configuration | .NET | Editors | RightWords

Highlighting colors are configurable in settings (default: black on
yellow).

The [Correct word] menu contains the same commands as the [Correct text].

The thesaurus input box uses the current word as the default input.

Code clean-up and light optimization. NOTE: SkipPattern filter is
relatively expensive. The sample/recommended pattern is simplified (see
About-RightWords).

= 1.0.5 =

Use FarNet 4.4.20 (new editor color API).

Experimental, with known caveats, highlighting of misspelled words in the
editor. This mode is turned on/off by the module menu command
[Highlighting].

Highlighting color is black on red and it is not yet configurable.

= 1.0.4 =

Fixed potential SkipPattern filter issues after correction in the same
line.

Dictionaries are sorted internally by numbers of valid word hits. This
slightly improves performance for 2+ dictionaries and provides word
suggestions from more expected dictionaries first.

= 1.0.3 =

Revised the suggestion menu actions and used numeric hotkeys.

Added [Add to Dictionary] command to the suggestion menu.
The user dictionary is the roaming file "RightWords.dic".

= 1.0.2 =

Fixed wrong text selection after word replacements.

Added [Ignore All] command to the suggestion menu.

Slightly improved the SkipPattern sample.

= 1.0.1 =

Added the SkipPattern to the settings.

Regular expression patterns in settings are created with
IgnorePatternWhitespace option (see About-RightWords).
