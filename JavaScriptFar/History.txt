= 0.4.1 =

Files *.cjs and *.mjs are treated as CommonJS and Standard modules regardless
of session DocumentCategory. As a result, sessions may have mixed script types.

= 0.4.0 =

Session files:
- use `_session.xml` instead of `_session.js.xml`
- support 2+ session scripts, any .js in `_session.*`

New configuration DocumentCategory defines how to run JS files.
The default is Script (scripts).
Other values: Standard and CommonJS (modules).
* This enables many useful cases but may break existing code.
* Use DocumentCategory Standard to restore previous behaviour.

Reworked debugging, no more blocking Far Manager on starting.
Sub-prefix `debug:` is no longer used in commands.

Sub-prefix `task:` is specified immediately after `js:`.
You can run commands as tasks as well as scripts.

New variable `args`, command line script parameters after `::`
js: @ script.js :: name = John Doe; age = 42

Added interop, see samples.

= 0.3.0 =

Requires FarNet 6.0.3

Folder sessions support configuration files `_session.js.xml`. Some powerful
features are not enabled by default or not known: loading scripts from web,
module search path, etc. Configure what a session needs. See new samples.

= 0.2.1 =

Add ClearScript.Core for Task.ToPromise() and Promise.ToTask()
See samples: async\flow.js and live plots in FarNet.ScottPlot

= 0.2.0 =

Use "folder sessions". This enables many useful features:
- common code in `_session.js`
- more useful debugging
- connecting to events
- using async jobs

Add `System.Diagnostics.Process` and `System.Runtime` to the pre-imported `clr` types.

= 0.1.0 =

New script running option `task:`.

= 0.0.2 =

Support modules, enable strict mode, variables must be declared.
[F5] from the editor shows simple results in the editor title.
Add more samples, tests, and docs.
Rename `lib` to `clr`.

= 0.0.1 =

Published on NuGet.
